    Firebase is a fully managed backend service developed by Google. We can connect to the backend without writing any
    code. Firebase developers to develop <b>Android</b>, <b>IOS</b>, and <b>Web apps</b>. For reporting and fixing app
    crashes, tracking
    analytics, and creating marketing and product experiments, firebase provides several tools. Backend-as-a-Service
    (BaaS) provider Firebase was a YC11 startup.
</p>
<p>
    It developed into a platform for developing next-generation apps on the Google Cloud Platform. A real-time database
    called Firebase (a NoSQLjSON database) enables the storage of a list of objects in a tree. Data can be synchronized
    between many devices. Where Realtime Database stores data within the form of a JSON, Cloud Firestore takes a way
    more structured approach.
</p>
<p>
    Firestore keeps its data inside objects. These documents contain key-value pairs and can contain any kind of data,
    from strings to binary data to even objects that resemble JSON The documents, in turn, are grouped into collections.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of Firebase</h2>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li>Real-time Database Helps to Store Synchronize Data.</li>
    <li>Firebase Provides a Crash Reporting Facility to Quickly Fix Bugs.</li>
    <li>Fast and Secured Web Hosting.</li>
    <li>Firebase Allows the Content Storage with Ease.</li>
    <li>Send Messages and Notifications to Specific Audiences.</li>

<h2>Create and Configure your Firebase Project</h2>
<p>
    The first step is to create a Firebase project and configure the native

        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Android/iOS</a>
    and Flutter apps to use Firebase services.
</p>
<ol class="ssq-blog-ol">
    <li>Navigate to the Firebase console.</li>
    <li>Select Add project.</li>
    <li>Type in the project name and click Continue.</li>
    <li>Continue with Enable Google Analytics for this project turned on.</li>
</ol><br />

<h2>Configuring an Android app</h2>
<p>
    You should be able to see the project dashboard once the project has been created. To get the Android project
    started, do the following:
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li>Select the Android icon.</li>
    <li>In the Register section, enter the package name and SHA-1 key and then click Register app.</li>
    <li>
        Place the google-services.json file in the Android app directory. This is how it should look:
        android/app/google-services.json
    </li>
    <li>Install the Firebase SDK as described in the Add Firebase SDK section.</li>
    <li>Continue to the console.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating a Flutter project</h2>
<p>
    To use any Firebase service, you must first install the firebase core plugin, which allows the app to communicate
    with Firebase.
</p>

<pre class="display-output">
    dependencies:
        flutter:
            sdk: flutter
            cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
            firebase_core: ^1.0.1
</pre>

<p>
    Creating a mobile application is generally a difficult and demanding undertaking. For the development of mobile
    applications, there are numerous frameworks available. Both iOS and Android offer native frameworks based on the
    Java programming language. The languages Objective-C and Shift.However, we must code in two distinct languages and
    use two different frameworks in order to create an application that supports both OSs. Mobile frameworks supporting
    both OS exist to aid in overcoming this complication.
</p>

<p>
    These frameworks range from straightforward hybrid mobile application frameworks built on HTML (using HTML for the
    user interface and JavaScript for the application logic) to complicated language-specific frameworks (which handle
    the laborious task of translating code to native code). No matter how simple or complex they are, these frameworks
    always have a number of drawbacks.
