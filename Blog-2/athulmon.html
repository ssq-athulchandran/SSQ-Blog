    As the use of mobile devices continues to grow, it is increasingly important for websites to be optimized for
    viewing on a wide range of devices. Responsive design is a design approach that ensures that a website's layout and
    content are optimized for viewing on any device, regardless of screen size or resolution. In this blog post, we will
    explore the principles of responsive design and how they can be implemented on your website to provide a seamless
    user experience for all visitors, no matter what device they are using. We will also discuss the benefits of
    responsive design and how it can help improve the user experience, search engine rankings, and overall success of
    your website.

<h2>What is Responsive Design?</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.sanesquare.com/services/ui-ux-design.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">Responsive Web Design</a>
    is a design approach used to create content that adjusts smoothly to various screen or device
    sizes. Developers size elements in relative units (%) and apply media queries that are used in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;"
        target="_blank">CSS</a> (Cascading Style Sheet), so their designs can automatically adapt to the browser space
    to ensure content consistency across devices. As the user changes the device from their laptop to an iPad or a
    mobile phone, the website should automatically change the resolution, image size, and scripting abilities for more
    user experience.
</p>

<p>
    <em><strong>
            Responsive Web design is not only about adjusting the screen resolutions and resizing the file size and
            images automatically. Here I covered all of these features, plus additional ideas for making your website
            more user-friendly.
        </strong></em>
</p>

<h2>Why Responsive Design?</h2>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Cost-effectiveness</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    It is very expensive for users to maintain separate sites for mobile and non-mobile devices. By using responsive
    design, only need to invest in one site that can be used by all types of device users.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Flexibility</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    If you have a responsive website, we can easily change and rearrange its contents. Therefore, there is no need to
    change it separately for mobile and non-mobile screens. This flexibility is a very good advantage.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Improved User Experience</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Improve User Experience is an important factor for a website owner. When a user visits our website, if the loading
    time of the website takes more time and if low-quality images are used in the website, it gives a bad impression to
    the users and also shows unprofessional.
</p>
<p>
    No one wants an unprofessional space in our world. Therefore, responsive design is a very effective design approach
    for providing a good user experience.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong> 4. Search Engine Optimization Gains</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Search Engine Optimization is a strategy that many companies used to increase their Google search rankings.
    Customers can find out about our company quickly by reaching the top of the search rankings.
</p>
<p>
    Through the Responsive Web Design approach, we can list out good mobile-friendly websites and through that, we can
    use SEO very effectively and achieve company ranking.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>5. Ease of Management</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Most businesses, especially small businesses, don't have time to update or refresh the way their website looks. But
    instead of hiring a designer to handle every aspect of your website, responsive design allows you to make changes
    yourself quickly and easily.
</p>
<p>
    Also, with a website, managing other elements of your marketing will be much easier. You'll never have to wonder
    whether you should link a mobile or desktop site in a social media update, or question whether or not all your
    redirect links are directing the right visitors.
</p>

<h2>Setting The Viewport</h2>
<p>To create a responsive website, add the following <em><code>< meta></code></em> tag to all your web pages:</p>
<p>

<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    </pre>
</div>
This will set your page's viewport, which will instruct the browser on how to control the page's dimensions and
scaling.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
</h4>
<img src="https://d26dzo6cruxhup.cloudfront.net/sanesquare/website-responsiveness-blog-content-1.png" alt="Example image of viewport meta tag" class="ssq-blog-img" width="80%" height="auto"
    style="margin-top: 0px !important; margin-bottom: 10px !important;">

<h2>How does It Work? Some Examples:</h2>
<h4>
    <strong>Adjusting Screen Resolution:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Devices come with different screen resolutions, definitions, and orientations. New devices with new screen sizes are
    being developed every day, and each of these devices may handle differences in size, functionality, and many
    features.
</p>
<img src="https://d26dzo6cruxhup.cloudfront.net/sanesquare/website-responsiveness-blog-content-2.png" alt="Different screens and their responsiveness" class="ssq-blog-img" width="80%" height="auto"
    style="margin-top: 0px !important; margin-bottom: 10px !important;">

<h2>How should One Design for these Situations?</h2>
<p>
    In addition to designing for landscape and portrait, you must consider hundreds of different screen sizes. Yes, this
    can be grouped into main categories and designed for each of them and each design can be flexible as needed.
</p>
<p>
    A few years ago, when flexible layouts were almost a "luxury" for websites, the only things flexible in a design
    were layout columns and text.
</p>
<p>
    Now we can make things more flexible. Images can be adjusted automatically and we have solutions to ensure layouts
    never break.
</p>

<h4><strong>Flexible Image</strong></h4>
<p>
    A major problem to be solved with responsive web design is working with images. There are many techniques for
    resizing images proportionally, and many are easy to do. The most popular option, documented in
    <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/" style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;"
        target="_blank">Ethan Marcotte's</a> article on <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/fluid-images/"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">fluid images</a>,
    but first tried by <a href="https://clagnut.com/" style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;"
        target="_blank">Richard Rutter</a>, is to use CSS's maximum width for an easy fix.
    <br />
    <em>
        <code> img { max-width: 100%; } </code>
    </em>
</p>

<h4><strong>Custom Layout Structure</strong></h4>
<p>
    For extreme size changes, we may want to change the layout entirely via a separate style sheet or, more efficiently,
    a CSS media query. It doesn't have to be messy; Most styles stay the same, while specific style sheets can inherit
    these styles and move elements around using floats, widths, heights, etc.
</p>
<p>
    For example, we might have a main style sheet that defines all the main elements like
    <em>#wrapper</em>, <em>#sidebar</em>, <em>#content</em>, and
    <em>#nav</em> along with colors, backgrounds, and typography.
</p>

    /* Default styles that will carry to the child style sheet */

    html, body {

    }
        
    #sidebar-left {
        width: 20%;

    </pre>
</div><br />

<h5>
    <strong>Here is the mobile.css content:</strong>
</h5>
<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id-2')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id-2"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    #wrapper {
        width: 90%;
    }

    #content {

    #sidebar-left {
        width: 100%;
        clear: both;

        /* Additional styling for our new layout */
        border-top: 1px solid #ccc;
        margin-top: 20px;
    }

    #sidebar-right {
        width: 100%;
        clear: both;

        /* Additional styling for our new layout */
        border-top: 1px solid #ccc;
        margin-top: 20px;
    }
    </pre>
</div><br />

<h3>Media Queries</h3>
<p>
    CSS3 supports all CSS media types, such as <strong>screen</strong>, <strong>print</strong>, and
    <strong>handheld</strong>, but adds dozens of new media features, including <strong>max-width</strong>,
    <strong>device-width</strong>, <strong>orientation</strong>, and <strong>color</strong>. New devices built after the
    release of CSS3 like android devices will of course support media features. Therefore, calling a media query using
    CSS3 features will work well to target these devices, and will be ignored if accessed by an older computer browser
    that does not support CSS3.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Example of Media Query:</strong>
</h4>
<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id-3')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id-3"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    /* Smartphones (portrait and landscape) ----------- */
    @media only screen and (min-device-width : 320px) and (max-device-width : 480px) {

        /* Styles */

    }
        
    /* Smartphones (landscape) ----------- */
    @media only screen and (min-width: 321px) {

        /* Styles */

    }
        
    /* Smartphones (portrait) ----------- */
    @media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {

        /* Styles */

    }
    </pre>
</div><br /><br />
