    In staff augmentation, workers are outsourced to meet an organization's current staffing needs. For instance, if a
    company intends to create a gaming app and needs seven developers, but their in-house development team only has
    four, <a href="https://www.sanesquare.com/blog/what-is-it-staff-augmentation"

    with sound expertise in building robust apps could take a month or two, delaying the project launch and depriving
    the company of predicted revenue.

    quickly hire the three additional developers within weeks, speeding up the project's completion and product launch.
    This model is typically cooperative and involves outsourcing, enabling the company to avoid the legal and paperwork
    hassles of full-time employment once the app hits the market. Furthermore, the developers who worked on the project
    can continue working for the company, eliminating the need for firing them.

<h2>Types of IT Staff Augmentation</h2>
<p>
    <strong>There are three ways to implement staff augmentation:</strong>
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Commodity-based augmentation:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    This type of augmentation involves hiring additional staff who may not possess highly specialized skills, but can
    handle basic tasks required by the business. Commodity-based augmentation is useful when there is a shortage of
    employees and businesses need to hire people quickly, or when they need to fill positions that do not require high
    levels of skill.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>2. Skill-based augmentation:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    This staff augmentation involves hiring workers with specialized skills, higher levels of education, and experience
    than average workers. Skilled workers can complete tasks more efficiently than others in the company and bring value
    to the organization with their unique skills.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>3. Highly-skilled augmentation: </strong>
</h4>
<p>
    This type of augmentation involves hiring highly skilled individuals from outside organizations for specific
    projects that require expertise, such as developing new products or solving complex problems. Highly-skilled
    augmentation can be classified into two categories: short-term and long-term.
</p>
<p>
    Short-term <a href="https://www.sanesquare.com/blog/benefits-of-IT-staff-augmentation"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self"
        title="Blog: Benefits of Staff Augmentation">staff augmentation</a> is for temporary employees who are hired to
    assist with a specific task, such as an intern who can help with design elements during an ad campaign. In contrast,
    long-term staff augmentation involves hiring someone for a year or more. This could be because the employee's skills
    have become indispensable to the business and they are needed for the long haul.
</p>
<h2>When to Use Staff Augmentation?</h2>
<p>
    Determining the appropriate circumstances to increase headcount is crucial for businesses. Here are five scenarios
    where staff augmentation can be beneficial:
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Reinforcing in-house teams</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Even if a company has in-house software developers, it may still be necessary to supplement or enhance current
    expertise while launching a new product or starting a new project. In such cases, augmenting the IT team can be a
    good idea.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>2. Bridging skill gaps</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Multiple projects may require different skills in various specialties, and the demand for these skills is constantly
    changing. Staff augmentation can help by adding experienced developers who possess specialized skills, thereby
    eliminating the need to train in-house employees.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>3. Expanding teams quickly</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    If a company needs a local developer with deep knowledge of specific technologies, the process of finding and hiring
    an expert can be time-consuming. Staff augmentation can save time by allowing companies to contact vendors, review
    developer resumes, and interview them.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>4. Meeting deadlines</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Hiring can be a lengthy process that takes an average of two months, from job posting to onboarding. Staff
    augmentation is an effective way to increase IT staff and meet needs regardless of the contract length. Companies
    can also augment from around the world with instant access to a global pool of software developers.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>5. Other models are not feasible</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    When a company needs more control over the developer's work and wants to manage their workload itself, other models
    may not be suitable. Smoothly integrating software developers into the team can also be an additional motivation to
    focus on the business.
</p>
<h2>Why is Staff Augmentation Popular in the IT Industry?</h2>

        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self"
        title="Blog: Best IT Staff Augmentation Company in India">IT staff augmentation</a> has gained immense
    popularity, thanks to its ease of hiring, especially in the rapidly growing software market. According to a
    Businesswire report, the software market's revenue is projected to reach almost $1,493 billion in 2025, with an 11%
    CAGR. This growth is possible due to the availability of a vast pool of software specialists, which is made possible
    by resource augmentation. This model allows for the distribution of IT workforce across businesses, enabling them to
    keep pace with the market's ever-growing demand.
</p>
<p>
    Staff augmentation's flexibility is perfectly suited to meet the increased hiring needs of today's IT businesses.
    In-house hiring involves several steps, from screening candidates to registration processes, which is time-consuming
    and resource-intensive. This approach is unsuitable when you need to onboard talent quickly for urgent projects.
    Firing such staff is also challenging, particularly when you need new workers for a brief period.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, <a href="https://www.sanesquare.com/blog/top-it-staff-augmentation-companies-in-india"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self"
        title="Blog: Top IT Staff Augmentation Company in India">staff augmentation</a> is a fast and efficient process.
    Outsourcing vendors handle all the hiring steps and formalities, selecting competent developers with the required
    expertise and proven work experience. All that is required from your company's executives is to interview and
    onboard suitable candidates. This helps your company remain agile and aligned with the project's timeline and
    delivery, averting revenue loss and a slow market launch.
