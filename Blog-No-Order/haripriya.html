<p>
    The Agile methodology is a method of project management that splits projects
    into phases. It involves continuous interaction with stakeholders and
    continuous improvement through each stage of software development. Whenever
    the work starts, teams go through a cycle of planning, execution, and
    evaluation. Constant collaboration with team members and project stakeholders
    is also essential in this project management method.
</p>

<h2>What is Agile Project Management Methodology?</h2>
<p>
    It is a method of project management that entails active communication and
    iterative development. Agile project management is based on the idea that a
    project may be improved upon continually throughout its life cycle with
    changes being made quickly and appropriately.
</p>
<p>
    Agile is one of the most popular methods to project management due to its
    flexibility, adaptability to change, and high level of client participation.
    Project management using the agile methodology involves developing projects
    according to 12 principles and 4 values.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>The Agile Manifesto's four values are as follows:</strong>
</h4>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
    <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
    <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
    <li>Responding to change by following a plan</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Agile process allows you to continuously adapt and develop your concept,
    scope, and design throughout the project since it works in ongoing sprints of
    project planning and execution. Agile projects necessitate an iterative
    methodology that allows for the incremental, frequent, and consistent delivery
    of useful

        target="_self" title="Best IT Service Provider for all Industries">products</a>
    to your customer or client.
</p>
<p>
    By using an inventive strategy, you can guarantee that your project team will
    regularly provide concrete items without being held up by alterations and
    changing specifications. Agile involves a high level of client participation
    and includes frequent progress reviews with both the project team and the
    customer.
</p>
<p>Several frameworks can be used to execute an Agile project.</p>
<p>
    <strong>The following are some of the more well-known ones:</strong>
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li>Scrum</li>
    <li>Kanban</li>
    <li>Extreme Programming</li>
    <li>DSDM</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Agile Software Development Manifesto lists 12 Agile principles that all
    projects should agree to.
</p>
<p><strong>They are:</strong></p>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Our Top Aim Is To Satisfy the Customer by Delivering Valuable Software on Time and on Schedule.</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The first <a href="https://kanbanize.com/agile/project-management/principles"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank"
        title="Agile Management Principles">principle of Agile methodology</a> emphasizes that clients should get
    project deliverables or iterations at frequent intervals throughout the project's life cycle, rather than just one
    product delivery at the end.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Accept Changing Requirements, Even if They Arise Late in the Development Cycle. Agile Methods Leverage
        Change for the Benefit of the Customerâ€™s Competitive Advantage.</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The writers of the Manifesto discovered that accommodating last-minute modification requests was challenging using
    traditional project management. With the help of this principle, Agile projects are guaranteed to be able to quickly
    react to any changes, regardless of how last-minute they may be.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Deliver Working Software Often, With a Preference for Shorter Timeframes (Every Two Weeks to Two
        Months)</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Agile projects are designed for frequent, short project deadlines that allow for a quick turnaround of workable
    products. Agile projects are frequently divided into one to four-week-long <a
        href="https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/sprints#what-is-a-sprint-in-agile"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank"
        title="Blog: What is a Sprint in Agile">sprints or project intervals</a>, each culminating in the delivery of a
    product.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>4. The Project Requires Daily Collaboration Between Business Professionals and Developers.</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    According to this Agile principle, effective communication with all stakeholders is essential for the project's
    success. The project team and any other important stakeholders are typically present for a brief daily meeting.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>5. Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals. Trust Them To Finish the Work While Providing Them With the
        Environment and Assistance They Require.</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The correct people need to be put in the right places and given the autonomy they need to accomplish their tasks
    well, according to a fundamental tenet of the agile project management methodology. It is critical to create a
    project team based on competencies rather than employment positions or titles. Rather of micromanaging the project
    team, the project manager should put more of his or her energy towards inspiring and assisting them.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>6. The Most Effective and Efficient Method of Communicating With and Among Members of a Development Team Is
        Face-to-Face Interaction.</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The Agile Manifesto highlights the significance of co-locating teams and stakeholders whenever possible, as
    face-to-face communication is more successful than email or phone.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>7. The Primary Indicator of Progress Is Functional Software.</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The Agile methodology seeks to give complete, working deliverables. Every additional demand, such as project
    documentation, should always be subordinate to this purpose. Delivering functional products is regarded as being
    more significant than other metrics like hours worked or time passed.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>8. Sustainable Development Is Encouraged Through Agile Methods. The Sponsors, Developers, and Consumers
        Should Be Able To Keep up the Pace Indefinitely.</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    This rule states that each iterative cycle or sprint within an Agile project should proceed at a constant speed.
    With regular production of usable items, this breakdown should make overtime and schedule disruption unnecessary. It
    should also build a repeatable cycle that the team may follow continuously.
