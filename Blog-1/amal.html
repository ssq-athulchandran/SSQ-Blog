    Flutter GetX is a Fast, Stable, Extra-light, and Powerful Flutter Framework! Whenever we tend to start building
    associate applications in an extreme flutter, we tend to need to decide what state management we wish to use. It'd
    be easier for you to make this decision with this journal.
</p>

<p>
    Here, throughout this tutorial: Flutter state management using GetX, I'd value more highly to justify GetX, a robust
    <strong>flutter framework</strong>.
</p>

<h2>What is GetX?</h2>
<p>
    State management permits you information transferring at intervals to the appliance. And whenever information is
    passed, the application's state is updated, consequently reconstructing the system. Thus, developers need to be
    notably careful regarding managing the state of the associate in the nursing application as a result of state
    updates may usually seem dear for a fancy application.
</p>

<p>
    Flutter traditionally provides stateful contrivance to manage states in applications. However, we wish to affect
    some limitations once using of
    <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html#:~:text=A%20stateful%20widget%20is%20a,the%20user%20interface%20more%20concretely."
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Stateful Widgets.</a>
    To overcome the restrictions, we tend to square measure ready to select Flutter state management using GetX.
</p><br />

<p>
    GetX can be a strong and lightweight resolution provided by Flutter to manage states and their updation.
</p>

<h3>It provides:</h3>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li>High-performance state management</li>
    <li>Intelligent dependency injection</li>
    <li>Quick and smart route management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why GetX?</h2>
<p>
    So, let's dive a touch deeper into why we wish GetX to manage the state at intervals of the flutter app. GetX
    improves <a href="https://sanesquare.com/" style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;"
        target="_self">flutter application</a>in three fully different criteria:
</p>

<ol class="ssq-blog-ol">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Productivity:</strong>
        Developers can merely implement GetX state management flutter with the help of straightforward syntax. No matter
        how difficult a code snip is also, you will be ready to save time with GetX flutter. It'll increase productivity
        by decreasing the event time delivering more performance.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Organization and Readability:</strong>
        GetX decouples the scan. By providing an easy and uncomplicated syntax, the business logic becomes more readable
        and formatted.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Performance:</strong>
        As mentioned in the prime of, GetX focuses on but minimum resources are also consumed, which can facilitate in
        rising the appliance performance. It doesn't use ChangeNotifier or Streams. See below the RAM chart depicting
        varied state managers.

<h2>Install GetX</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold !important; margin-bottom: 5px !important; margin-top: 15px !important;">
    flutter pub add get
</h4>
<p>
    Run the on prime of command in Android studio/vs code's terminal, and it will add the foremost recent GetX plugin to
    pubspec.yaml.
</p>
<p>
    We square measure reaching to cowl 3 sections during this more tutorial
</p>

<ol class="ssq-blog-ol">
    <li>State management for basic counter app</li>
    <li>Navigation Using GetX</li>
    <li>Inflating UI parts whereas not context</li>
</ol>

<h3>Flutter State Management's Using GetX</h3>
<p>
    Here I will be ready to turn out one counter app by separating UI logic and business logic using a controller, which
    I'd use for this. Don't worry if you are not tuned in to all or any of this; I am explaining those well one by one.
</p>
<p>
    You can see the project structure.I have created using the recommended GetX pattern, with a scan,
    controller, and binding class. Scan class handles the code for inflating the UI, which might appear on the screen.
    The binding class would be associated with a particular page, and during this class, we tend to square measure ready
    to instantiate controller classes. In controller class, we tend to square measure ready to define variables and
    business logic functions, in our case increments operate. Also, at intervals the most.dart, we have got declared
    <strong>GetMaterialApp</strong> not <strong>MaterialApp</strong> so we tend to square measure ready to use all the
    functionalities of GetX framework.

    CounterController class
</h4>
<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    class CounterController extends GetxController {
        final count = 0.obs;
        void increment() {
            count.value++;
        }
    }
    </pre>
</div><br />

<p>
    Here I even have declared the count variable with .obs, that suggests count is discernible, and whenever there is a
    modification throughout this worth, we tend to square measure ready to hear that worth via controller class. In
    distinction to suppliers, we tend to not have to be compelled to call notifylisteners. At intervals the increment
    operates, I'm simply incrementing the count variable price.

                            ),

                                backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.all(Colors.blue),
                            ),
                            onPressed: () {
                                counterController.increment();
                            },
                            child: Text('Increment', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 14, color: Colors.white)),

                        ],
                    ),
                ),
            );

    }
            
    </pre>
</div><br />

<p><b>final CounterController counterController = Get.put(CounterController());</b></p>
<p>
    Using the on prime of syntax at intervals in the build methodology, I even printed the controller class. The text
    button will call the increment methodology printed at intervals in the controller class and Text which might show
    the updated worth of the count.
</p>

<p>
    Here I even have used one simple example of counter application to understand all the classes, structure, and state
    management merely. We can achieve many more using GetX flutter using following this observable pattern and writing
    cleaner code.
</p>

<h3>Let's dive into the navigation part,</h3>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold !important; margin-bottom: 5px !important; margin-top: 15px !important;">
    Navigation using GetX
</h4>
<p>
    In the screenshot connected at intervals to the state management block, we have in addition created a page name
    home. so let's say we wish to haunt the house page from the counter class on one button click. we tend to square
    measure ready to simply call the GetX navigation block, as shown below.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold !important; margin-bottom: 5px !important; margin-top: 15px !important;">
    Get.to(HomeView());
</h4>
<p>
    Pretty simple. Isn't it? rather than vocation up many boilerplate codes, we tend to square measure ready to simply
    call this and move to a special screen. Moreover, there are fully different decisions to send to a distinct page
    too.
</p>

<p>
    For instance, you will be ready to simply replace the house screen with a presently open screen below. It suggests
    that this screen which could get replaced won't be at intervals on the stack.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold !important; margin-bottom: 5px !important; margin-top: 15px !important;">
    Get.off(HomeView());
</h4>
<p>
    And, if we wish to urge eliminate all previous stacks, we tend to square measure ready to call Get.off(HomeView());
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold !important; margin-bottom: 5px !important; margin-top: 15px !important;">
    Get.offAll(HomeView());
</h4>
<p>
    Apart from that, we can pass knowledge between routes and show animation before we go another route and open a
    screen as a dialog using flutter GetX.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    I covered the basic structure of GetX State Management in a flutter in this blog; you can adapt this code to suit
    your needs. This was my brief introduction to GetX State Management On User Interaction, and it works with Flutter.
    I hope this blog has given you enough information to experiment with GetX State Management in your flutter projects.
