    Microservices has become a buzz word in the software industry, but many are still not sure what it means. When you
    connect with a development team and they say they are using microservices for building applications, you don't have
    any idea about what they mean. Let us have a look at what microservices are and how it helps us with building
    scalable systems.
</p>
<h2>What are Microservices?</h2>

        title="Custom Software Development Services">Microservice</a> is an architecture followed by developers where
    they break a huge application into smaller modules. Each module will have its own processes and databases (DB) to
    store data. The modules communicate with each other using the http protocol and Rest APIs. Before microservices, we
    had monolithic applications, where the entire application was just one module, with millions of lines of code. Just
    imagine the complexity of fixing an issue in such a code!
</p>
<p>
    Each module in a microservices application can have a different technology stack or tech stack, meaning one module
    can be built with Java and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"

        title="More about PostGreSQL">PostGreSQL</a> DB, another one in Python and MongoDB and a third one with node.js
    and redis DB. This flexibility improves scalability, fault isolation, improves deployment processes and the
    application is adaptable to constant changes.
</p>
<p>
    For example, let us say we have a medical application where laboratories, pharmacies, doctors, hospitals and end
    users can register and sell/buy the services. Each of these modules can be created as a single application. We can
    also create applications based on their functionality - a module for notifications like email, SMS, whats app,
    another one for excel/pdf generations etc.
</p>
<h2>Advantages of Building with Microservices:</h2>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Scalability</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Every module is an independent application which makes it easier to add many instances of the same module which
    helps in controlling the traffic to that module. Let us take the case of the medical application, where we are
    expecting huge traffic for our end user management portal. It is easier to scale that single application than the
    entire application and provide traffic control systems for the same.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>2. Fault isolation</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose we require a quick fix in our pharmacy application and it should not affect the hospital application where
    some critical processes are running. Microservices provides a quick solution - since pharmacy is an isolated
    application, it is easier to make changes and deploy it, while other applications are left untouched.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>3. Technology Agnostic</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    We can use any technology with which we are confident for each module. With a development company having employees
    with experience in various programming languages and technologies, this provides faster development and optimized
    solutions for each module.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>4. Secure Data</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Isolating sensitive data into a module and providing extra layers of security for that module protects our data from
    intrusions. Providing wider access to less secure data makes our applications user friendly. Both can be achieved
    easily when we use the microservices architecture.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>5. Outsourcing</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Modules can be outsourced to third party partners for development while the core data and functions can be kept safe
    with the organization. In the case of the medical system, we can outsource the eCommerce part of pharmacy to
    businesses providing eCommerce solutions. We can also develop modules for other organizations who are using
    microservice architecture.
</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of Microservices</h2>
<p>
    As for every architecture and processes, microservices has its own disadvantages too. Most architects support
    monolithic services when starting an application from scratch, and then evolving to microservices along the way.
    Some disadvantages of microservices are Complexities with distributed systems.
</p>
<p>
    We have to make sure the applications are communicating properly and provide reconciliation methods and queueing
    systems to fetch lost data. Proper load balancing needs to be maintained as the number of requests between
    applications will be more. Managing many applications is a bit more difficult than managing one application.
