    How can we create web applications with Java? According to Stack Overflow and Statista, Java is one of the most
    commonly used programming languages ​​for building web applications. As most of you probably already know, Java is a
    high-level, object-oriented, class-based programming language. It is built with minimal dependencies. After more
    than two decades of release, Java is still loved by programmers.
</p>
<p>
    Since Java applications are compiled in bytecode, they can run on any <a

        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</a>
    regardless of the operating system and the architecture of the computer system, thus ensuring portability.
    Additionally, Java provides Servlet and JSP technologies that help developers easily build and deploy web
    applications on the server. Like other languages, Java also has frameworks like Spring and Hibernate to simplify the
    web application development process.
</p>

<h2>What is a Web Application?</h2>
<p>
    Software programs that can be accessed using any web browser are called Web applications. Typically, the front end
    of web software is created using scripting languages ​​such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are supported by
    almost all web browsers. In contrast, the backend is created using any programming language such as Java, Python,
    Php and a database. Unlike device-based apps, there is no specific device to build internet apps; we can use any
    supported IDE to create web applications.
</p>
<p>
    Let's look at the technical terms we need to be familiar with before <a

        applications.</a>
</p>

<h2>Defining Java Web Application Technologies</h2>
<p>
    Before developing any web application it is necessary to set up Java, IDE for writing code, Server <a
        href="https://tomcat.apache.org/" style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;"
        target="_blank">(Tomcat)</a> as web container for Servlet, and Database (MySQL or Oracle) on your gadget
    properly.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Java IDE</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    A Java IDE is an integrated development environment for Java programming; many also provide functionality for other
    languages, and an IDE typically provides a code editor, compiler or interpreter, and debugger that developers access
    through a unified Graphical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">User Interface (GUI)</a>.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Java Servlet API</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Servlets provide URL mapping and request handling functionality in your Java web applications. They are used to
    handle requests received from the web server, process the request, render the response, and send the response back
    to the web server. In Java, we use servlets to create web applications.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. JavaServer Pages(JSP)</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Java Server Pages or JSP is a technical specialty that simplifies the development of dynamic web applications. It
    also allows developers to simultaneously add servlet code snippets to text documents. JSP consists of static facts
    that can be expressed in plain text format and JSP factors that determine how a web page creates dynamic content.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>4. JSP Standard Tag Library</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    JSTL stands for JSP Standard Tag Library. JSTL is a standard tag library that provides tags that control the
    behavior of JSP pages. JSTL tags can be used for iterations and control statements, internationalization, SQL, etc.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>5. JavaServer Faces</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    JavaServer Faces or Jakarta Server Faces technology consists of a set of APIs for marking up user interface
    components and managing their state, and a JSP custom tag library for expressing JSF interfaces in JSP pages. Java
    Server Faces is designed to be flexible, taking advantage of current web and user interface standards, without
    restricting developers to a certain protocol, system or language.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>6. JDBC API</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API provides generic data access. Using the JDBC API, developers can access
    any source of information, from spreadsheets to relational databases and flat files. Java uses two packages java.sql
    and javax.sql to connect, manipulate and receive records from databases.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>7. Java Persistence API</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The Java Persistence API provides an object-to-relational mapping tool to help developers manage relational data in
    Java web applications. JPA internally defines object-relational mapping and standardizes these mapped objects using
    XML or annotations to map objects into database tables.
</p>

<h2>How to Create a Web Application using Java?</h2>
<p>
    Before developing a web application, Java, IDE to write code (Eclipse or Netbeans), server (Tomcat) as web container
    for servlets and database (MySQL or Oracle) should be properly configured on your machine.
</p>
<p>
    Tomcat can be configured with Eclipse to facilitate application development and deployment. In Eclipse Preferences,
    select Server Runtime Environments and find your Tomcat server version. For the runtime environment, specify the
    apache tomcat directory location and JRE information. Create a server with useful resources to access the server
    interface. That's it, we are ready to create and run our first servlet on the Tomcat server.
</p>
<p>
    Now open the Eclipse IDE and select <strong>File > New > Dynamic Web Project.</strong> Enter the project name
    <strong>FirstServletProject</strong>, use the default project location, then <strong>click Next</strong>, check
    Generate web.xml deployment descriptor and <strong>click the Finish</strong> button.
</p>
<p>
    Now to create the servlet, select <strong>File > New > Servlet</strong> and <strong>click the Finish</strong>
    button, this will
    generate the skeleton code for the servlet.
</p>
<p>
    Once the servlet is created, you can add HTML using the GET method to invoke the HTTP request shown below and run
    the servlet.

    <pre id="session-id"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    package com.journaldev.first;

    import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
    
    /**
        * Servlet implementation class FirstServlet
    */

    @WebServlet (description = "My First Servlet", urlPatterns = {"
        /FirstServlet" , "/FirstServlet. do"), initParams =
        {@webInitParam(name="id" , value="") ,@webInitParam(name="name"
        „value= "ABC" )})

    public class FirstServlet extends HttpServlet {
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        public static final String HTML_START = " < html>< body>";
        public static final String HTML_END = "</ body></ html>";

        /**
        * @see HttpServlet#HttpServlet)
        */

        public FirstServlet ) {
            super ();
            // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
        }

        /** 
        * @see HttpServlet#doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response)
        */

        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
        HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException,
        IOException {
            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
            Date date = new Date();
            out.println(HTML_START + "< h2>Hi There!</ h2>< br/>< h3>Date="
                +date +"</ h3>" + HTML_END) ;
        }

        /**

        protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException
        IOException {

            }
        }
    }
    </pre>
</div><br />

<p>
    Now, while running our servlet, several errors are shown because the servlet-api jar file is not added. So we will
    add the jar file by right clicking on the project and then going to <strong>Build Path > Set Build Path > Add
        External JAR</strong> option.
</p>
<p>
    From here you can navigate to the directory where the server is installed, select the servlet-api.jar file, click
    Open to continue, then Apply and Close to add the jar file to the project.

    Although servlets are a good choice at first, they are difficult to inspect and maintain large responses containing
    dynamic data. It is for this reason that JSP was introduced. The JSP technology is also server-side and has the same
    characteristics as HTML, but it can also add dynamic content if needed. Because JSP is similar to HTML, it is easy
    to write and suitable for presenting data.
</p>
<p>Using the JSP code in the code below, we get the same result as the servlet code.</p>
