<h2>Types of ERP Systems</h2>
<p>
    Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are designed to integrate and manage various business processes such as
    finance, accounting, human resources, supply chain management, and customer relationship management. ERP systems can
    be broadly classified into three types based on their deployment model: <strong><em>On-premise ERP, Cloud-based ERP,
            and Hybrid ERP.</em></strong>
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>1. On-premise ERP:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    On-premise ERP systems are installed on local servers and managed by the organization's IT department. This type of
    ERP system requires substantial upfront investment and ongoing maintenance and support costs. On-premise ERP systems
    are suitable for organizations that require complete control over their data and IT infrastructure. They offer high
    levels of customization and flexibility but also require substantial investment in hardware and infrastructure.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Cloud-based ERP:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Cloud-based ERP systems are hosted on remote servers and accessed over internet. This type of ERP system requires
    minimal upfront investment and eliminates the need for managing and maintaining on-premise hardware. Cloud-based ERP
    systems offer scalability and flexibility, making them ideal for small and medium-sized businesses that require
    access to enterprise-level functionality. They also offer frequent updates and upgrades, making it easier for
    organizations to stay up-to-date with the latest features and functionalities.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Hybrid ERP:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Hybrid ERP systems combine both on-premise and cloud-based <a
        href="https://www.sanesquare.com/services/custom-erp-software-solutions.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self"
        title="Custom ERP Software Solutions">ERP solutions</a>. This type of ERP system allows organizations to keep
    critical data on-premise while leveraging cloud-based solutions for less critical processes. Hybrid ERP systems
    offer the best of both worlds, providing the flexibility and scalability of cloud-based ERP solutions, while also
    providing the control and security of on-premise ERP solutions.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>
        Apart from the deployment model, ERP systems can also be classified based on their functional scope:
    </strong>
</h4>

<p>
    <strong>1. Horizontal ERP:</strong> Horizontal ERP systems are designed to serve a wide range of industries and
    businesses. They offer generic functionalities that can be adapted to meet the specific requirements of different
    industries.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Vertical ERP:</strong> Vertical ERP systems are designed to meet the specific requirements of a
    particular industry or vertical. These systems offer industry-specific functionalities and are highly customized to
    meet the specific needs of different industries.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Best-of-breed ERP:</strong> Best-of-breed ERP systems are designed to offer the best possible
    functionality in a specific business process, such as finance or HR. These systems are highly specialized and offer
    a narrow range of functionalities, but are highly efficient in the processes they support.
</p>
<p>
    ERP systems can be broadly classified into three types based on their deployment model: on-premise ERP, cloud-based
    ERP, and hybrid ERP. ERP systems can also be classified based on their functional scopes, such as horizontal ERP,
    vertical ERP, and best-of-breed ERP. Organizations must carefully evaluate their business requirements and choose an
    ERP system that best fits their needs.
