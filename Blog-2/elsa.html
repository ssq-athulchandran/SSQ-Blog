    A preview feature of Java 19 includes <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/425"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Virtual Threads</a>, a compact
    implementation of Java threads. High-throughput concurrent applications can be written, maintained, and observed
    with a great deal fewer work thanks to virtual threads. The well-known thread-per-request style of programming is
    given fresh life by virtual threads, enabling it to scale with almost ideal hardware use.
</p>

<p>
    Virtual Threads can be supported by existing applications and libraries with no modification because they are fully
    compatible with the current <strong><em>"Thread"</em></strong> API. By supporting the current debugging and
    profiling interfaces, virtual threads make it simple to troubleshoot, debug, and profile virtual threads using
    current tools and methods.

    The primary output of OpenJDK's <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.org//display/loom/Main"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Project Loom</a>, virtual threads
    are introduced to the Java platform for the first time in Java 19; this is the key deliverable. This is
    simultaneously one of the biggest improvements to Java in a long time and a hardly noticeable change. Virtual
    Threads radically alter how the Java runtime communicates with the underlying operating system, removing major
    barriers to scalability, but they make only minor adjustments to how we create and manage concurrent systems.
    Virtual Threads behave almost identically to the threads we are used to, and there is hardly any additional API
    surface. There is more unlearning than learning to be done to use virtual threads successfully.
</p>

<h2>Virtual Threads</h2>
<p>
    A different Java.lang.Thread implementation is virtual threads. Threads that use Java's garbage-collected heap to
    store their stack frames rather than the large operating system-allocated memory chunks. The memory footprint for a
    virtual thread starts at just a few hundred bytes and extends and contracts automatically as the call stack grows
    and shrinks, so we don't have to anticipate how much stack space a thread would need or make a general estimate for
    all threads.
</p>
<p>
    Platform threads, which remain the unit of scheduling, are the only threads that the operating system is aware of.
    The Java runtime makes arrangements for code to execute on a virtual thread by mounting it on a platform thread
    known as a carrier thread. When a virtual thread is mounted, the necessary stack frames are temporarily copied from
    the heap to the carrier thread's stack, and the virtual thread borrows the carrier stack while it is mounted. Code
    running in a virtual thread can be unmounted from the carrier thread, and any updated stack frames copied are
    returned to the heap, enabling the carrier thread to work on anything else when it might otherwise block due to IO,
    locking, or other resource availability (such as running another virtual thread.) Virtual Threads are unmounted from
    their carriers rather than blocking when a blocking operation on them is encountered in almost all of the blocking
    places in the JDK.
</p>
<p>
    There is not much to understand to use virtual threads because they are just threads and have minimal additional API
    surface of their own. But to use them successfully, there are quite a few things we need to relearn.
</p>

<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li><strong>Everyone Out of the Pool.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Overuse of ThreadLocal</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Everyone Out of the Pool</h3>
<p>
    The patterns of thread production are the hardest to unlearn. Java developers have learned that it is generally far
    better to let <strong><em>ExecutorService</em></strong> manage and pool threads in a policy-driven way than to
    create threads directly. Java 5 introduced the java.util.concurrent package, which includes the
    <strong><em>ExecutorService</em></strong> framework. But pooling turns into an antipattern when dealing with virtual
    threads. (We don't have to stop using <strong><em>ExecutorService</em></strong> or the encapsulation of policy that
    it offers; we can acquire an <strong><em>ExecutorService</em></strong> that produces a new virtual thread per task
    by using the new factory function
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">
        Executors::newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor
    </a> )
</p>
<p>
    Because they are so lightweight, virtual threads can be created even for brief operations, and attempting to reuse
    or recycle them is pointless. Virtual Threads were created specifically to handle brief tasks like an HTTP fetch or
    a JDBC query.
</p>
<h3>Overuse of ThreadLocal</h3>
<p>
    As a result of virtual threads, libraries could also need to modify how they use
    <strong><em>ThreadLocal</em></strong>. The usage of <strong><em>ThreadLocal</em></strong> to cache resources that
    are expensive to allocate, not thread-safe, or just to prevent repeated allocation of a frequently used object is
    one of its occasional (and, some would argue, misuse) applications (e.g., ASM uses a
    <strong><em>ThreadLocal</em></strong> to maintain a per-thread char[] buffer, used for formatting operations.) This
    is an ad-hoc kind of pooling; if these objects need to be pooled, they should be pooled explicitly. A
    <strong><em>ThreadLocal</em></strong> is used to amortize the production cost of a costly resource across numerous
    activities that might execute in the same thread.
</p>

<h2>API & Platform Changes</h2>
<p>
    A preview feature is virtual threads and the accompanying APIs. This means that to support virtual threads,
    the-enable-preview switch is required.
</p>
<p>
    There is no new VirtualThread base type because virtual threads are just java.lang.Thread implementations. But there
    are several new API points for creating and analyzing threads that have been added to the Thread API.
    A new <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.Builder.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Thread.Builder</a>
    class, new factory methods for <strong><em>Thread::ofVirtual</em></strong> and
    <strong><em></em>Thread::ofPlatform,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Thread::startVirtualThread</em></strong> to start
    a task on a virtual thread in one step are all included. Although they are only used to create platform threads, the
    old thread builders continue to function as before.
</p>
<p>
    Virtual and platform threads behave differently in a few specific ways. Virtual threads are always daemon threads;
    they are unaffected by the Thread::setDaemon function. Virtual threads have primacy at all times. NORM PRIORITY,
    which is unchangeable. Some (defective) legacy techniques, such as ThreadGroup and the Thread methods halt, suspend,
    and delete, are not supported by virtual threads. A thread's virtuality can be determined using the function
    Thread::isVirtual.
</p>

<h2>Preparing the JDK</h2>
<p>
    Although Project Loom's major output is virtual threads, the JDK has undergone several enhancements to guarantee
    that programs will use virtual threads effectively.
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>New socket implementations:</strong>
        To better support virtual threads, JEP 353 <em>(Reimplement the Legacy Socket API)</em> and JEP
        373 <em>(Reimplement the Legacy DatagramSocket API)</em> replaced the versions of Socket,
        ServerSocket, and DatagramSocket (including making blocking methods interruptible in virtual threads.)
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Virtual-thread-awareness:</strong>
        Virtual threads are now known to almost all blocking sites in the JDK, and they will unmount a virtual thread
        instead of stopping it.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Revisiting the use of ThreadLocal:</strong>
        Because of the anticipated shifting thread usage patterns, many ThreadLocal uses in the JDK were revised.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Revisiting locking:</strong>
        Critical intrinsic locks were replaced with ReentrantLock because acquiring an intrinsic lock (synchronised)
        currently pins a virtual thread to its carrier. (In the future, the relationship between virtual threads and
        intrinsic locks will likely be enhanced.)
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Improved thread dumps:</strong>
        Greater control over thread dumps is offered to filter out virtual threads, group relevant virtual threads
        together, or create dumps in machine-readable forms that can be post-processed for improved observability.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Even while virtual threads are Project Loom's major focus, several Loom side projects improve on virtual threads.
    The first is a straightforward framework for organized concurrency, which provides a potent way to manage and
    coordinate collaborating teams of virtual threads. Extent local variables are another option; they are comparable to
    thread locals but are better suited (and more efficient) for use with virtual threads.
