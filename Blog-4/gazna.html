    travel and tourism industry can offer personalized services to their customers. For example, by tracking a

    repetitive tasks such as sending out confirmation emails or tracking customer inquiries, companies can free up staff
    to focus on more important tasks.

<h3>5. Identifying Sales Opportunities</h3>

    CRM also helps companies identify sales opportunities. By tracking customer interactions and analyzing data, travel,
    and tourism companies can identify patterns and trends, which can help them target their sales efforts more
