    Spring Boot framework is based on java that is built on the Spring framework. Additionally, it is a Java-based
    open-source framework for developing micro Services. The Pivotal Team created it, and it is used to create
    independent, production-ready spring apps. Without needing to create a lot of boilerplate code, Spring Boot helps

    by taking an opinionated perspective of the Spring platform. Spring setup is
    typically not necessary for Spring Boot projects.

    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Simple to maintain and set up.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does Spring Boot work?</h2>
<p>
    By utilizing the <strong><em>@EnableAutoConfiguration</em></strong> annotation, Spring Boot configures your
    application automatically based on the dependencies you have added to the project. For instance, Spring Boot creates
    an in-memory database if the MySQL database is on your classpath but you haven't set up any database connections.
</p>
<p>
    The class with the <strong><em>@SpringBootApplication</em></strong> annotation and the main method serves as the
    spring boot application's entry point.
</p>

<p>
    Using the <strong><em>@ComponentScan</em></strong> annotation, Spring Boot automatically scans every component
    included in the project.
</p>

<h2>Spring Boot Features</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>1. Autoconfiguration</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Consider that you want to build a new library that you can utilize across your program. Even if you are able to
    create and integrate the code, you could still need to perform a lot of manual settings. The autoconfiguration
    function offered by Spring Boot enters the picture at this point.
</p>
<p>
    Spring Boot gives you the option to select dependencies for your project when you create a new one. These are the
    dependencies that the autoconfiguration feature uses to load particular preset configurations. The Auto
    Configuration class is strengthened by <strong><em>@Conditional</em></strong> annotations that turn on beans under
    specific conditions. When an application first launches using Spring Boot, these conditionals are evaluated.
</p>

<p>
    You must annotate your code with <strong><em>@EnableAutoConfiguration</em></strong> or
    <strong><em>@SpringBootApplication</em></strong> in order to use autoconfiguration.
</p>

<p>
    A spring-named file. During startup, factories automatically load. There are numerous configuration classes
    referenced in it. The file may be found in the dependency org.spring
    framework.boot:spring-boot-META-INF/spring.factories autoconfigures directory.
</p>
<p>
    Many classes are accessible for use, but you can eliminate them by utilizing
    <strong><em>@EnableAutoConfiguration's</em></strong> exclude feature.
</p>

<h3>
    <strong>2. Spring Initializer</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Your Spring Boot projects can be bootstrapped using the utility Spring Initializr. Project creation is made possible
    by this Spring Boot functionality via cURL, various IDEs, and its own Spring CLI. Although it doesn't produce any
    application code, it does offer a simple project structure. Just write the application code, that's all.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose a project, the programming language of your choice, and add dependencies like dev tools, actuator,
    web, etc. with the help of Spring Initializr. After choosing one of the available options on the Spring Initializr
    screen, creating a project only requires hitting the Generate button. When choosing a Gradle or Maven project, for
    instance, the produced project includes the pom.xml or the Gradle build specification. A class with a main () method
    is also included to help bootstrap the program. There is an application context that makes use of the empty
    properties file and Spring Boot auto-configuration so that you can add configuration properties.
</p>

<h3>
    <strong>3. Externalized Configuration</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    All configuration settings in Spring Boot applications are read from the application.properties or application.yaml
    resource file. However, there may be instances where you want to transfer your settings to a different environment.
    At this point, you might need to configure these properties, in which case your application will need to be rebuilt
    and tested again across all environments. You will also need to redeploy your application in the production
    environment each time a change is made.
</p>
<p>
    Spring Boot gives you the option to externalize your configuration to get around this issue. Utilizing the
    application code from one environment in another is known as externalizing the configuration. You can reuse your
    code in different settings by externalizing your setup with Spring Boot. These files can be used to externalize
    configuration:
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;"
            target="_blank">YAML Files</a>
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Environment Variables</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Properties Files, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    It's possible that you'll need to comprehend what is occurring inside the application in order to troubleshoot it
    and analyze the logs. For instance, which beans are configured, how frequently a certain service was used, or how
    frequently a certain service failed. The window into your application is the actuator. You can use the Actuator
    framework to inspect your application health-check endpoints without having to install any additional software or
    tools. Tracking data such as metrics, information, and other things are made simple using Spring Actuator.
</p>
<p>
    Actuator endpoints allow you to interact with your application in addition to monitoring. There are a number of
    endpoints already included in Spring Boot, and you can also add your own actuator implementations.
</p>

<h3>
    <strong>4. Spring CLI</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    To create a Spring application quickly, utilize the Spring Boot CLI command-line tool. You can code utilizing your
    understanding of Java and the Spring CLI without having to continuously develop reusable code because Groovy scripts
    can be executed. Utilizing the starter component, which resolves dependencies, allows you to begin a new project.
</p>
<p>
    A few commands provided by this Spring Boot feature can be used to launch development on a more conventional Java
    project using the Initializr. For instance, the init command gives the Initializr an interface via which to build a
    base project. The project structure is present in the final zip file, and you can put your own configuration there.
    If not, you can also modify the code.
</p>
<p>
    With its scalable and effective toolkit for creating Spring applications with a microservices architecture, Spring
    Boot has become a crucial component of the Java ecosystem. It uses straightforward default settings for unit and
    integration tests, which accelerates the development and deployment procedures. Additionally, Spring Boot saves
    developers time and energy by enabling them to create strong apps with clear and secure setups without having to
    spend a lot of time and energy learning the nuances of Spring.
