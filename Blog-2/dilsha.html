    Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique that focuses more on the implementation of a feature.
    Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a development technique that focuses on the system's behavior. Let's have a
    look at the difference between TDD and BDD.
</p>
<h2>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
<p>
    Test-driven development is an iterative development process. In TDD, developers write tests before writing enough
    production code to satisfy those tests and subsequent refactoring. Developers use the specs and first write tests
    that describe the behavior of the code. It's a short cycle of testing, coding, and refactoring.
</p>
<p>
    The key ingredient for being effective with test-driven development is understanding what it truly is.TDD means
    letting your tests drive your development (and your design). This can be done in unit tests, functional tests, and
    acceptance tests. Since you're checking behavior instead of

        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">testing a code</a>,
    you'll usually end up writing a very different type of test that is more resilient to future changes.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of TDD</h2>
<p>
    In comparison to older methods, test-driven development produces high-quality applications in a shorter amount of
    time. To successfully implement TDD, developers and testers need to accurately predict how the application and its
    features will be used in the real world.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">1. Better Program Design and Higher Code Equality</h4>
<p>
    When writing a test, the programmer should first define the goal that the piece of code wants to achieve. Developers
    will appreciate the experience it provides and its consistency with the rest of the code overall. Developers think
    of everything from interfaces to work plans.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">2. Detailed Project Documentation</h4>
<p>
    When writing tests against a particular requirement, programmers quickly create rigorous, detailed specifications.
    All possible user actions are already included. Thus, we already have a scenario that determines the future. It
    saves users and programmers additional work by not having to create complex documentation.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">3. TDD Speeds up the Project Development Process Time</h4>
<p>
    When writing code without using TDD, it takes time for programmers to understand whether the code works correctly.
    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">test-driven development</a>,
    developers quickly realize that something is wrong when a test should pass. As a result, time is saved during the
    development phase of the project, and teams can quickly fix code if they detect code corruption.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">4. Code Flexibility and Easier Maintenance</h4>
<p>
    Refactoring, part of the TDD process, is about optimizing existing code to make it easier to read and implement.
    Promotes clean and attractive code structure. Even if you're not a developer, you may be able to read the code and
    understand its message.
</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of TDD</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">1. No Silver Bullet</h4>
<p>
    Testing can help you find bugs, but they can't find bugs that you just put in your test and implementation code. If
    you don't understand the problem you're trying to uncover, writing a test is most likely useless.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">2. Slow Process</h4>
<p>
    Once you start using TDD, simple implementations can seem time-consuming. Before you can finally start writing code,
    you need to believe in an interface, write test code, and run tests.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">3. Team Members have to do it Together</h4>
<p>
    TDD affects code planning, so we recommend that all members of your team use TDD, or none at all. And to this day,
    sometimes it's hard to justify TDD to management. Because half the time developers write code that doesn't show up
    in the product, they often feel it takes longer to implement the latest features. It helps when the whole team
    agrees on the importance of unit testing.
</p>

<h2>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</h2>
<p>
    Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that evolved from TDD (Test Driven
    Development). It differs in that it is written in a common language, improving communication between technical and
    non-technical teams and stakeholders. In both development approaches, tests are written before the code, but in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Behavior Driven Development</a>
    (BDD)
    tests are more user-centric and based on system behavior.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of BDD</h2>
<p>
    Software design in BDD begins with acceptance tests. Stakeholders and the development team, serve as the base for
    communication.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">1. Strong Collaboration</h4>
<p>
    With BDD, all the involved parties have a strong understanding of the project and they can all have a role in
    communication and constructive discussions. BDD increases and improves collaboration. It makes it simple for all
    project participants to interact with the product development cycle. And by using plain language, all can write
    behavior scenarios.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">2. High Visibility</h4>
<p>
    Everyone has a clear understanding of how the project is progressing because a universal language is used.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">3. The Software Design Follows Business Value</h4>
<p>
    The value and demands of the business are highly valued by BDD. By setting priorities with the client, based on the
    value it provides, developers can provide a better result because they have a strong understanding of how the client
    thinks. By concentrating on the value, no pointless features are constructed.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">4. The Ubiquitous Language</h4>
<p>
    The ubiquitous language is understandable by all the members of the team, which reduces misconceptions and
    misunderstandings and makes it easier for new members to join the working process.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">5. More Confidence from the Developers' Side</h4>
<p>
    In general, teams using BDD are more confident that they haven't broken their code and are more predictable when it
    comes to their work.
</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px !important;">6. Lower Costs</h4>
<p>
    By improving the quality of the code, you are reducing the costs of maintenance and minimizing the project's risks.
</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of BDD</h2>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li>Before you can use BDD, you need to understand the concept of TDD.</li>
    <li>Behavior-driven development is incompatible with the waterfall approach.</li>
    <li>Testers using BDD should have sufficient technical expertise.</li>
    <li>If the requirements aren't carefully established, BDD might not work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the Difference between TDD and BDD?</h2>
<p>
    The main difference between TDD and BDD is that TDD focuses on individual units or features of the application
    whereas BDD focuses on the application as a whole.
