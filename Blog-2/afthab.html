    Many applications need to solve general problems like presenting a unified user interface, presenting data, and
    allowing data entry. For different applications in particular domains that can be adapted for reuse, developers can
    create a general solution for them. These types of solutions can be built as Angular libraries, which can be
    published and shared as npm packages. An Angular library is an Angular project that, unlike an application, cannot
    run on its own. An Angular library should be imported and used in the application. Any

        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">Angular Developer</a> can use
    other libraries that have been published as npm packages by the Angular team or third parties.
</p>

<h3>Library Choosing</h3>
<p>
    When selecting a library, we must consider weekly downloads, errors, update times, and so on; otherwise, there is a
    risk of making app errors or having any issues with the application, which will affect the app's performance; thus,
    before installing the package, we must ensure that it is up to date.
</p>

<h3>Libraries Installations</h3>
<p>
    Angular libraries are built as npm packages; these are integrated with the Angular CLI; you have to install the
    package, and after that, we have to import a module to integrate the reusable library.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong> <em>Eg: npm install packagename, npm I package name</em> </strong>
</h4>
<p>You can use the npm command to install all packages written in that package. JSON file</p>

<h3>Libraries Usage</h3>
<p>
    By using angular libraries, you can improve application performance or may chance to reduce performance, it depends
    upon choosing libraries, if you choose good libraries it will increase application performance and can reduce codes,
    angular libraries usage updating made good performance to application, earlier angular js is used, after updation of
    typescript angular libraries were founded, its made very useful, and angular is maintained by google, so you can
    expect angular updating zealously.
</p>

<h3>Creating Library</h3>
<p>
    If we have developed features that are suitable for reuse, we can create our libraries. This type of library can be
    used locally in one's workspace or can be published as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)#:~:text=npm%20(originally%20short%20for%20Node,the%20JavaScript%20runtime%20environment%20Node."
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">npm packages</a> to be shared with
    other projects or Angular developers. This package can be published to the npm registry, the private npm Enterprise
    registry, or a private package management system that is supported by npm packages. The dedication of these packages
    as a library is an architectural decision. Putting code in a separate library is more difficult than putting
    everything in one application. When the library is used in multiple applications, this capability must be
    successful.
</p>
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px !important;">
    <strong> <em>The syntax for creating libraries are: </em> </strong>
</h4>

<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    ng g library  < name > [options]

    ng generate library < name > [options]
    </pre>
</div><br />

<h3>Library Typing</h3>
<p>
    Typings on.d.ts files are included. If our libraries package does not include typings and an error occurs, we must
    install the typings package's libraries. Types defined in this for library installation into the workspace are
    automatically added to the TypeScript configuration for the library's project. If it doesn't contain types, we can
    still add them manually.
</p>

<h3>Updating libraries</h3>
<p>Updated by using the ng command to update individual library versions.</p>

    In todayâ€™s world web development become vast and popular most of us want part of this. The most demanding and
    highest-paying job is web development. It offers the most job satisfaction with a rating of 3.3 out of 5 which is
    among the top 43% of careers. When we take about web development Angular units be ignored. Angular developed by
    Google is a framework used for full-stack.It contains Javascript libraries. We talk about full-stack, Angular plays
    a major role in <strong>MEAN</strong> which means:-

<h3>Reusability with Angular libraries</h3>
<p>
    Library in Angular App is reusability code that determines Angular components, services, or projects. These are like
    normal applications. The only dissimilar one is Angular application of these projects cannot execute on their own we
    want to import this for used them.
</p>

    libraries are also a main part of Angular. As a leading Angular application company at Sanesquare Technologies, We
