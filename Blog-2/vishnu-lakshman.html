<p>
    A design pattern is a broad, reusable response to a typical issue in a particular environment. The patterns will be
    demonstrated using Angular, but they apply to other frameworks as well.
</p>
<p>
    It is a set of methods for resolving a typical issue that are not language-specific. Therefore, a design pattern
    does not reflect a specific implementation but rather an idea. Design patterns are primarily used to show how to
    tackle a general problem, rather than a specific problem.
    You may increase the flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of your code by adopting design patterns.
</p>
<p>
    This design pattern should be used to create open-source software that is simple to test and maintain.
</p>
<p>The three primary categories of programming patterns are:</p>

    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Behavioral Design Patterns</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creational Design Patterns:</h3>
<p>
    Creational design patterns are focused on the process of making things. When a choice needs to be made at the time a
    class is instantiated, several design patterns are employed.
</p>
<p>
    It offers a variety of object generation strategies, enhancing flexibility and making use of already written code.
</p>

<h4 style="color: rgb(9,55,203);">Singleton</h4>
<p>
    The Singleton design pattern is one of the most well-liked creational design patterns since it enables you to
    guarantee that a class has only one instance while offering a global access point to this instance. As it offers one
    of the greatest ways to build an object, this design pattern falls under the category of creational patterns . The
    dependency injection mechanism in <a href="https://www.sanesquare.com/services/web-design-and-development.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">Angular</a>
    takes care of the pattern for us. In contrast to the services offered in
    the components, which are instantiated for each instance of the component, the services given at the application's
    root are singleton instances.
</p>

<h4 style="color: rgb(9,55,203);">Factory</h4>
<p>
    A creational design pattern called the factory method addresses the issue of constructing product objects without
    identifying their concrete classes.The design pattern known as a factory allows objects to be created that have the
    same interface (or extend from the same class), but different implementations depending on the environment. It is
    possible to override the factory method in a subclass because it is merely a method. When we wish to give users of
    your library or framework a way to enhance its internal components, we use the factory method.
</p>

<h3>Structural Design Patterns:</h3>
<p>
    The composition of classes and objects to create larger structures is the subject of structural design patterns.
</p>

<h4 style="color: rgb(9,55,203);">Adaptor</h4>
<p>
    One of the artefacts is wrapped in an adaptor to conceal the intricate translation process taking place behind the
    scenes. The wrapped object has no idea that there is an adaptor at all. An adapter that transforms all the data to
    imperial units like feet and miles, for instance, can be wrapped around a device that functions in metres and
    kilometres.The adapter pattern serves as a connecting element between two dissimilar interfaces. Given that this
    design pattern combines the functionality of two independent interfaces, it falls under the category of a structural
    pattern.
</p>

<h3>Decorator</h3>
<p>
    A structural design pattern called decorator enables you to add additional behaviours to objects by enclosing them
    in special wrapper objects that already have the behaviours. One of the twenty-three well-known GoF design patterns,
    which explain how to handle recurring design issues and create adaptable and reusable object-oriented software, or
    objects that are simpler to implement, update, test, and reuse, is the decorator pattern.
</p>

<h3>Behavioral Design Patterns:</h3>
<p>
    These patterns are focused on algorithms and how responsibilities are distributed among objects.
</p>

<h4 style="color: rgb(9,55,203);">Iterator</h4>
<p>
    A collection of elements can be traversed using the iterator behavioural design pattern without revealing the
    collection's underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).This technique is utilised to provide a method for
    sequentially accessing the components of a collection object without having to be aware of its underlying
    representation.
</p>

<h4 style="color: rgb(9,55,203);">State</h4>
<p>
    A behavioural design pattern called state enables objects to change their behaviour as their internal states change.
    The item seems to have altered its class.Without the use of conditional statements, this can be a cleaner approach
    for an object to alter its behaviour at runtime and hence enhance maintainability.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    <strong>
        When applied appropriately, design patterns can be a crucial component of Angular apps. This makes it easier for
        engineers to locate the code. Maintaining the code standard is usually a good idea. Since the majority of our
        engineers these days don't adhere to design patterns, this post is being shared. I believe these sessions will
        be beneficial for developers. If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact us. We are the
