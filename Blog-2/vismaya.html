<p>
    Security testing is an integral part of software testing used to discover vulnerabilities, risks, or threats in
    software applications, prevent malicious attacks from outsiders, and keep software applications secure. The main
    purpose of security testing is to find all potential ambiguities and vulnerabilities in the application so that the
    software does not stop working. Running security tests identifies all possible security threats and helps
    programmers fix those bugs.
</p>
<p>
    General security requirements may include certain elements of confidentiality, integrity, authentication,
    availability, authorization, and non-repudiation. The actual security requirements tested will depend on the
    security requirements implemented by the system.

    many meanings and can be done in many ways. A security taxonomy can therefore help you make sense of these different
    approaches and implications by providing a baseline to work from.

<h4>
    <strong>Vulnerability Scanner</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to scan a computer, network, or application for known
    vulnerabilities. These scanners are used to discover vulnerabilities in specific systems. They are used to identify
    and detect vulnerabilities caused by misconfigurations and improper programming in network-based assets such as
    firewalls, routers, web servers, and application servers. Modern vulnerability scanners allow both authenticated and
    unauthenticated scanning. Modern scanners are usually available as

        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">SaaS</a> (Software as a Service).
    Delivered over the Internet and deployed as a web application. Modern vulnerability scanners often can customize
    vulnerability reports, installed software, open ports, certificates, and other host information that can be queried
    as part of the workflow.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>Security Scanning</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Security scanning can mean many things, but in a nutshell, it scans the security of websites, web-based programs,
    networks, or file systems to detect vulnerabilities and unwanted file changes. to detect. The type of security
    clearance required for a particular system depends on how the system is used. The more complex and complex your
    systems and networks are, the more thorough your security scans should be. Security scans can be run as a one-time
    check, but most companies that integrate this into their security practices purchase services that continuously scan
    their systems and networks.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most popular open-source software platforms to perform security scans is called Nmap. It has been around
    for a very long time and has the ability to find and exploit vulnerabilities in your network. A number of online
    scans are also available. However, these differ in effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>Penetration Testing</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Penetration Test</a> is an approved
    simulated attack performed on a computer system to assess its security.
    Penetration testers use the same tools, techniques, and processes as attackers to find and demonstrate the business
    impact of vulnerabilities in systems. Penetration testing typically simulates a variety of attacks that can threaten
    an organization. You can ensure that your system is robust enough to withstand attacks from authenticated and
    unauthenticated locations and various system roles. With the right scope, pests can dig into every aspect of your
    system.
</p>
<p>
    A penetration test can only confirm that a company's IT systems are not vulnerable to known issues on the day of the
    test. It's not uncommon for him to take a year or more between penetration tests. So if that's the only way to check
    security, vulnerabilities can exist for a long time without your knowledge.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>Security Auditing</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    A security audit reviews and assesses an application or network to verify compliance with standards, regulations,
    and corporate policies. It is a systematic and in-depth examination of a system or network to assess system security
    and to detect and report security vulnerabilities. Security audits are typically conducted by an independent third
    party or internal audit team.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>Ethical Hacking</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The role of an ethical hacker is very similar to that of a penetration tester, but with multiple responsibilities.
    This is an umbrella term that includes all techniques and other related cyberattack techniques. Ethical hacking
    includes all hacking techniques and other related computer attack techniques. The goal of ethical hacking, similar
    to hacking by criminals, is to find security flaws in an organization's systems. However, as the word "ethical"
    implies, attackers must obtain the approval of the organization before conducting an attack.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>Risk Assessment</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    A security risk assessment identifies, assesses, and implements critical security controls for your application.
    Conducting a risk assessment gives organizations a holistic view of their application portfolio from an attacker's
    perspective. Administrators can make informed decisions about resource allocation, tools, and implementing security
    controls. Conducting an assessment is therefore an integral part of an organization's risk management process.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>Posture Assessment</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    A security posture assessment is conducted to ensure that the cybersecurity within an organization is strong. Many
    steps need to be taken to increase cybersecurity level maturity. So they are part of the posture assessment.
</p>
<p>
    Having a robust cybersecurity system in place in your organization is extremely important. Otherwise, security will
    be compromised. Data breaches, cyber-attacks, and online threats are major concerns for most businesses, and
    companies are not investing effort and money into cybersecurity assessments.
