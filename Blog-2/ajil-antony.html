    This blog explains the differences between the constructor inside a TypeScript class vs OnInit and how to make the
    best decision. If you're just getting started with Angular or have been using it for a long, you might have concerns
    like these:
</p>

<p>
    Should I bind data and inject dependencies into the constructor? When does ngOnInit be used? What distinguishes a
    constructor from OnInit in Angular?
</p>

<p>
    I'm here to address those questions because they are valid. Before we start, it's essential to understand that a
    constructor is not an <a href="https://www.sanesquare.com/services/mobile-app-development.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">Angular feature</a>.
</p>
<p>Before moving on to the ngOnInit lifecycle hook, let's discuss constructors.</p>

<h3>What is a Constructor?</h3>
<p>
    A constructor is a unique method that is called each time we build a new object. In general, it is used to
    initialize the members of the class. It is not an Angular feature, but rather an attribute of the class
    (typescript), a principle in object-oriented design.
</p>
<p>The purpose of a constructor will be clear to you if you have experience with object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>When a class instance is formed, a constructor is called first:</p>

<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    class Pizza {
        constructor() {
            console.log('Hello world!');
        }
    }
        
    // create a new instance, constructor is 
    // then invoked by the *JavaScript Engine*!
    const pizza = new Pizza();
    </pre>
</div><br />

<h3>Constructors in Angular</h3>
<p>
    When using Dependency Injection, we give dependencies using constructors, which are important in Angular. When a
    class is formed, Angular examines the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Constructors</a> and searches for
    providers that match the types of arguments in the Constructors. They are then bound to the class after being
    located.
</p>
<p>You probably did something similar, injecting a different class into the constructor:</p>
<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id-1')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id-1"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
    
    @Component({...})
    class PizzaComponent {
        constructor(
            private route: ActivatedRoute
        ) {}
    }
    </pre>
</div><br />

<p>
    By doing so, ActivatedRoute will be bound to the class and accessible through the component class's this .route
    method.
</p>
<p>
    A constructor, in my opinion, is where you should wire up your dependencies and leave it as simple as possible. It
    is more difficult to test the constructor because Angular does not directly call it.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px;">
    The addition of the ngOnInit lifecycle hook, which fires as soon as the Angular component is prepared, addresses the
    fact that Angular has no control over when this constructor is called.
</p>
<p>
    A class's lifecycle hooks are merely methods that define significant moments in time. OnInit, OnDestroy, and Changes
    are a few of the lifecycle hooks offered by Angular.
</p>
<p>
    A quick fact for you before we continue: the OnChanges lifecycle hook is called first when an Angular component is
    built.
</p>
<p>
    The OnInit hook is the following lifecycle hook to be called.
    What does the OnInit lifecycle hook offer us and when should we use it because of this?
</p>

<h3>OnInit Lifecycle Hook</h3>
<p>
    Angular components can expand in size and complexity, which frequently necessitates the injection of several
    dependencies, the declaration of properties, and the binding of observables. A constructor would be the best
    location for injection but not to handle the wiring. Angular calls the lifecycle hooks throughout the change
    detection cycle but not the constructor until after the component tree has been assembled.
</p>
<p>
    This is where <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/OnInit"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">ngOnInit</a> comes in. After
    importing the OnInit interface and utilizing the implements to provide us with some type of safety, we can declare
    ngOnInit as a method:
</p>

<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id-2')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id-2"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
    
    @Component({...})
    class PizzaComponent implements OnInit {
        constructor(
            private route: ActivatedRoute
        ) {}
        
        ngOnInit() {
            // subscribe when OnInit fires
            this.route.params.subscribe(params => {
                // now we can do something!
            });
        }
    }
    </pre>
</div><br />
<p>
    Unit testing is made simpler by this method because we have control over the lifecycle hook. The ngOnInit lifecycle
    hook is the ideal location for adding more intricate logic and initializing the component.
</p>
<p>What actually occurs when Angular instantiates the component and calls ngOnInit is as follows:</p>
<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id-3')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id-3"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    const instance = new PizzaComponent();

    // Angular calls this when it's ready
    instance.ngOnInit();
    </pre>
</div><br />
<p>
    Wiring up observables, communicating with services, and making any necessary requests are all easily accomplished
    with the ngOnInit lifecycle hook.
</p>
<p>
    Another incredibly significant feature of ngOnInit is that Angular calls it precisely when the component's @Input()
    properties are prepared:
</p>

<div class="ssq-blog-clipboard">
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('session-id-4')" class="fa fa-copy ssq-blog-text-copier"></button>
    <pre id="session-id-4"
        style="page-break-inside: avoid; display: block; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll; background-color: #091517; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); -moz-border-radius: 2px; border-radius: 3px; color: #83f9fbff;padding:0;">

    @Component({...})
    class PizzaSingleComponent implements OnInit {
        @Input() pizza: Pizza;
    
        constructor() {
            console.log(this.pizza); // undefined
        }
        
        ngOnInit() {
            console.log(this.pizza); // { name: 'Pepperoni', price: 399 }
        }
    }
    </pre>
</div><br />
<p>
    The initial pass of Angular's Change Detection is also included in this ngOnInit phase, so any @Input() properties
    are available there but are purposefully undefined in the constructor.
</p>
<p>
    The fact that the constructor is invoked by the JavaScript engine while ngOnInit() is called by Angular is the first
    and primary difference between the two methods.
</p>

<h3>When to use ngOnInit & the constructor in Angular</h3>
<p>
    The constructor is used for dependency injection and initializing class members in object-oriented programming.
</p>

<h3>Implementing constructors in Angular</h3>
<p>
    In Angular, dependencies are introduced into the component class using the constructor. And make the constructor as
    clear as you can. If the constructor logic is straightforward, unit testing can be quite simple.
</p>

<h3>Use of the ngOnInit() method in Angular</h3>
<p>
    As mentioned, Angular calls ngOnInit after building the component DOM. Additionally, we will inject all necessary
    dependencies and processed input bindings using constructors.
</p>
<p>Now that everything is set up, we can add the actual logic to the ngOnInit() method.</p>
<p>
    Even if the logic doesn't need DI, DOM, or input bindings, it's usual practice to utilize ngOnInit to perform actual
    work.
</p>

<h3>Constructor vs. ngOnInit in Angular</h3>

<table class="ssq-blog-table">
    <tr>
        <th style="text-align: center;">ngOnInit</th>
        <th style="text-align: center;">Constructor</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>One Angular life cycle hook technique</td>
        <td>Angular has nothing to do with the typescript</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The additional Typescript feature to the class's prototype has nothing to do with Angular ngOnInit.</td>
        <td>Constructor is changed to a function that has the same name as the newly generated class.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Called by Angular</td>
        <td>By Javascript Engine</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>When a component is initialized, Angular calls this method. </td>
        <td>When creating a class object, the Constructor is automatically invoked.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>This is actual business logic in practice</td>
        <td>Deployed to inject dependencies</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>When the call is made, everything is arranged</td>
        <td>Not every aspect of a component is initialized at the time it is invoked.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Despite their subtlety, the variations are significant. You are now prepared to select the appropriate OnInit action
    as we have covered the constructor role in detail. Our use of OnInit ensures that bindings are accessible and usable
    to the fullest extent.
