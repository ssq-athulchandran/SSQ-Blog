<h2>What is Cross-Browser Testing?</h2>
<p>
    Cross-browser testing determines whether a web app or website can be accessed by different browsers, devices, and
    assistive technologies. Because different browsers read website code differently, developers must ensure that
    current and previous browsers understand the code correctly. By testing and understanding this process, you can
    identify browser-specific compatibility errors so you can debug faster. Even if you've written an application that
    works well in your favorite browser, you still need to test it to ensure its success with your users. This includes

<h2>Why am I having Cross-Browser Issues?</h2>
<p>
    Browsers change over time and so do their capabilities. Different browsers may or may not support different
    performance levels. Also, different browsers recognize components differently, which is one reason why cross-browser
    issues arise.

<h3>Cross-Browser Compatibility Issues and Solutions</h3>
<p>
    There are compatibility issues between various browsers that can occur during testing. Below I have tried to cover
    some of the most common issues. It also provides solutions to problems.

<h4>
    <strong>1. HTML/CSS Validation</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Validating CSS and HTML code can be a major cross-browser issue for developers. This is because the code is read and
    processed differently depending on which browser you use. Even small mistakes like forgetting to close a tag can
    cause errors. If an error occurs, some browsers will fix it automatically, while others will not display the
    functionality at all. This is one of the most common compatibility issues, but fortunately, it's easy to fix.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. JavaScript Issues</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    As browsers change, so do code updates and patches on a regular basis. In particular, JavaScript cross-browser
    compatibility issues arise when older browsers cannot recognize newer JavaScript functions.
</p>
<p>
    It might be as simple as using a linter or opening your browser's dev tools to find the source of the problem. Doing
    this manually can be time-consuming and burdensome for large projects. A more holistic approach is needed.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Resetting CSS</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    By default, your browser has its own theme layout (CSS styles) that is applied to your website. To use your own
    layout on your website, you need to override the default settings. Until you do this, the website may appear
    differently depending on which browser you use. So how do you solve cross-browser compatibility issues with layouts?
</p>
<p>
    To reset your website to the same basic style, you should use a CSS reset stylesheet. Adding this style sheet will
    prevent layout design issues in various browsers such as Internet Explorer and Chrome.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>4. DOCTYPE Error</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Omitting the most basic line of code, the doctype, can cause your website to display incorrectly. Many browsers
    don't check the doctype, but older browsers and older versions such as Internet Explorer 8.0 can. Strict mode
    provides stricter error checking. In quirks mode, error checking is not as strict as in this mode.
</p>
<p>
    This is designed to support backward compatibility with older or older browser versions. Normally, when a browser
    can't find a doctype tag in your code, it goes into quirks mode. However, if your browser doesn't support HTML5, it
    may not know which version to search for, and your tags may become unresponsive. As a result, the website does not
    display as intended.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>5. Layout Compatibility</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    We've already talked about resetting CSS, but removing the browser's default theme can lead to layout compatibility
    issues between browsers, as some layouts are not supported. It can also be caused by the theme not responding on
    some browsers. Luckily, it's very easy to fix this. When working with modern layouts, you can use tools like flexbox
    and CSS grid. Or you can use float which is supported by most browsers.
