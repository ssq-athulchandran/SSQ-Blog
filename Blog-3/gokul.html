    Smoke Testing is an important aspect of <a href="https://sanesquare.com/services/custom-software-development.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">Software Development</a> that
    ensures the quality and functionality of a
    software application. It is a quick and simple test that verifies a software's basic functionality to ensure that
    the most critical features are working correctly. The primary goal of smoke testing is to detect major flaws early
    in the development process, saving time and resources that would otherwise be spent on resolving these issues. Smoke
    testing improves overall software quality by catching these defects early.
</p>

<h2>When are Smoke Tests Performed?</h2>
<p>
    The technique of Smoke Testing ensures that the build that was received from the development team may be tested.
    When the build is a release candidate, it can also be run as part of the build process alongside a more in-depth
    test. Once the database and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">GUI interface</a> is stable, work
    can begin. Additionally, when new fundamental functionality is included in a system, smoke testing is frequently
    carried out. But unlike unit or regression testing, this test is not exhaustive.
</p>
<p>
    When working on a module, a smoke test may not always be sufficient to thoroughly test a change, especially when
    employing new code. Every build includes a smoke test, but this does not absolve developers of the duty to test
    their modifications before submitting them to the repository. A manual smoke test should be performed by developers
    before a change is committed.
</p>

<h2>Procedure for Smoke Testing</h2>
<p>
    Designing test cases is not necessary for smoke testing. All that is required is to select the necessary test cases
    from those that have already been designed. Smoke Testing, as previously stated, focuses on core application
    workflow, so we select test case suits that cover the application's most important features. The number of test
    cases should be kept to a minimum and the execution time should not exceed 30 minutes.

<h3>Smoke Testing Characteristics</h3>
<p>Runs rapidly (the exact definition of "rapidly" depends on the circumstance).</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Self-scoring is possible, as it should be for any automated test.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Comprehensive system coverage is provided.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Can be managed by developers and included in the quality control
        process.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Exposes common mistakes in a fresh build, but it doesn't have to be
        complete.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Positive Aspects of Smoke Testing</h3>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Early testing stage bug discovery is aided by this.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">It aids in identifying problems brought on by the integration of
        components.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">It aids in confirming that the bugs corrected in the previous build DO
        NOT affect the application's core functions.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">In order to conduct the smoke testing, a very small number of test cases
        are needed.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Smoke testing can be completed quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Negative Aspects of Smoke Testing</h3>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">The thorough examination is not covered by smoke testing.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Due to the limited amount of test cases and non-exhaustive testing, we
        were unable to identify any other critical flaws.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Types of Smoke Test</h2>
<p>
    Smoke testing is an important part of software development because it ensures the quality and functionality of a <a
        href="https://sanesquare.com/services/web-design-and-development.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">web application</a>. There are
    various types of smoke tests, each with its own set of needs and requirements. The following are some of the most
    common types of smoke tests.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>1. Build Verification Test (BVT)</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    A build Verification Test is performed after a software build is complete and is designed to verify that the build
    is stable and ready for further testing.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Build Acceptance Test (BAT)</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The build Acceptance Test is performed by the customer or end-user to verify that the software meets their
    requirements and is acceptable for use.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Component Test</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Component Test is performed on individual components of the software, such as a specific module or function, to
    verify that they work correctly.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>4. End-to-End Test </strong>
</h4>
<p>
    End-to-End Test is performed on the entire software system to verify that all components are working together
    correctly.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>5. Regression Test</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    A Regression Test is performed after changes have been made to the software to verify that the changes have not
    broken any existing functionalities.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>6. User Acceptance Test (UAT)</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    User Acceptance Test is performed by end-users to verify that the software meets their requirements and is suitable
    for use in real-world scenarios.
</p>

<h2>Important Distinction Between Sanity and Smoke Test</h2>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li>
        Sanity testing seeks to validate "rationality," whereas smoke testing seeks to validate "stability."
    </li>
    <li>
        Developers and testers can both perform Smoke Testing while testers perform Sanity Testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sanity testing validates new functionality, such as bug fixes, whereas smoke testing validates the system's
        critical functionalities.
    </li>
    <li>
        While Sanity testing is a subset of Regression Testing, Smoke testing is a subset of Acceptance Testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sanity testing is not programmed or recorded, whereas smoke testing is.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sanity testing only validates a single element, whereas smoke testing validates the whole system from beginning
        to end.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Smoke Testing should always be carried out on every build in software engineering since it aids in the early
    detection of issues. The software build must complete a smoke test activity before moving on to the system stage.
    Every build that is put through testing must pass a smoke test. This holds for both major and minor system releases
    as well as new development.

    The <a href="https://www.sanesquare.com/services/staff-augmentation/hire-qa-analyst.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">QA team</a> must confirm that the
    application under test is running on the correct build version before beginning smoke testing. Testing the
    application's stability is an easy operation that takes very little time. Smoke tests can save test effort while
    enhancing the application's quality. Depending on the customer and the business, smoke testing can be done manually
    or automatically.
