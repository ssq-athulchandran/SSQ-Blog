    Selenium has become the go-to choice for test automation due to its versatility, ease of use, and extensive
    community support. It enables developers and testers to automate web applications across multiple platforms and
    browsers, making it a valuable tool for companies with a diverse range of users. With its open-source nature,
    Selenium also provides cost-effective testing solutions, allowing businesses to streamline their testing processes
    and save resources.

    In this blog, we will explore the key features and benefits of Selenium, its integration with other testing tools,
    and the reasons why it has become the preferred choice for <a

        automation</a> in the industry. Join us as we delve into the world of Selenium and its widespread adoption.
</p>

<h2>What is Selenium?</h2>
<p>
    Selenium is a portal open-source framework for testing <a
        href="https://www.sanesquare.com/services/web-design-and-development.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self"
        title="Best Web Development Company">web applications</a>. The Selenium framework uses a standard test domain
    language called "Selenese" for writing test scripts. It also supports testers in writing test scripts. The framework
    consists of a diverse tool stack for automating software testing, each with different application-specific or
    project-specific capabilities. The selenium test suite consists of the following:
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Selenium WebDriver</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Selenium RC or Remote Control</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Selenium IDE</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Selenium-Grid</li>
</ul>

<h4>
    <strong>1. Selenium WebDriver</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Selenium WebDriver is a browser automation framework that accepts instructions and sends them to the browser. This
    is implemented by browser-specific drivers. Communicate directly with your browser for control. Selenium WebDriver
    supports various programming languages ​​such as Java, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, and javascript.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Selenium RC or Remote Control</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    It was Selenium RC, or Selenium 1, was Selenium's main project until the merger with WebDriver spawned Selenium 2.
    It relies on JavaScript mainly for automation. We support Ruby, PHP, Python, Perl, C#, Java, and Javascript.
    Supports almost all browsers.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Selenium IDE</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is primarily a Firefox plugin. This is one of the simplest
    frameworks in the Selenium suite. Scripts can be recorded and replayed. If you're scripting in the Selenium IDE, you
    should use Selenium RC or Selenium WebDriver to create more advanced and robust test cases.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>4. Selenium-Grid</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Selenium Grid is a tool used in conjunction with Selenium RC. Used to run tests in parallel on different computers
    using different browsers. This means that multiple tests are run simultaneously on different computers using
    different browsers and operating systems.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Platforms and browsers supported by Selenium:</strong>
    <br />
    At a high level, the main operating systems supported by Selenium are:
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Google Chrome</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        Internet Explorer 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 on Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 in any combination. IE 6
        is no longer supported. Drivers may support running 32-bit and 64-bit versions of browsers.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Firefox</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Safari</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Opera</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">HTML Unit</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Phantom JS</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Android (using Selendroid or Appium)</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">iOS (using ios driver or Appium)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who Uses Selenium Testing Software?</h2>
<p>
    Whether you're a developer or a test engineer, you probably run Selenium tests.
    <br />
    The only difference between them is:
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">The goal in front of them.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">The skills they possess influence the tools they use to write test
        scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Test engineers are generally very happy with automating tests using Selenium or other frameworks. However, testing
    headless browsers turns out to be less relevant to our needs (with exceptions).
    <br />
    Software developers are unlikely to use the full-fledged Selenium framework very often. Leverage headless browser
    testing solutions such as Google Puppeteer. It depends on the quality goals each persona has.
</p>

<h2>Why Choose Selenium over other automated testing tools?</h2>
<p>
    Selenium encourages testers to write scripts in a programming language to run (reuse) the same test script on
    multiple browser platforms. WebDriver will become part of her W3C standard for all browsers and develop browsers
    that automatically support Selenium. The interesting thing about this test <a
        href="https://www.sanesquare.com/blog/automation-testing-framework"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self"
        title="Best Software Testing Company">automation tool</a> is that it involves the tester in testing the UI
    modules and provides a wide range of options to test, compare the results and check if they match the final expected
    application behavior.
</p>
<p>Selenium has many benefits, but here are some of the main benefits it brings:</p>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Transparency:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Ensure agility and transparency across cross-functional teams (developers, quality assurance, operations, customers,
    and management) in the SDLC process.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Platform independent:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Eliminate software tester time writing test scripts for each platform under test. It follows the principle of
    writing test scripts, so they can run on any platform.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Quicken's TTM and TTD:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    This is because with manual testing, testing is very painful and uncertain, and the time for product delivery and
    the market launch is not met. The growth the price of the general project. However, Selenium avoids testers writing
    test scripts for each platform. This saves time and eliminates regression testing procedures. This optimizes test
    time and speeds up TTM and TTD.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>4. Facilitate continuous integration efforts:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Continuous integration and continuous delivery are modern agile enablers for software development processes. By
    automating the entire testing process, Selenium acts as a catalyst for your organization's successful continuous
    integration (CI) practices.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>5. Visibility in end-to-end testing:</strong>
</h4>
<p>For end-to-end applications, testing with selenium increases transparency.</p>

<h4>
    <strong>6. Reduce processing time:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The Selenium framework makes it easy for test teams to automatically run multiple test cases in parallel on
    multi-browser platforms. This ensures the highest test quality and reduces turnaround time.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>Integration with other tools</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Selenium with Java is known as the rest available jars such as ExtentReports, Sikuli, and Appium. The Selenium tools
    give testers the flexibility to integrate with these jars and push their functionality to new frontiers.
</p>
<p>
    1. Selenium's integration with "ExtentReports" allows you to generate charts and reports that can be used to provide
    your customers with deeper insight into test status.

    <br />

    2. Selenium integration with "Sikuli" allows you to test web applications with videos and images.

    <br />

    3. Testing web apps on Android or iOS platforms can be achieved by integrating Selenium with Appium.

    <br />

    You can create test automation using the low-code or no-code Selenium framework. These allow business testers to
    automate some routine tasks. Selenium can be used to automate various development languages ​​such as Java,
    JavaScript, C#, and Python. It can be used in conjunction with low-code frameworks such as BDD (such as Perfectos
    Quantum) or through no-code solutions such as Codeless.
