<p>
    At its core, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed public ledger that serves as a record-keeping technology.
    With blockchain, it is possible to record transactions and track assets, and it powers popular cryptocurrencies such
    as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin, in particular, is known for its low-cost transaction fees and its decentralization
    from government-issued currencies.
</p>
<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
<p>
    Blockchain is the technology behind popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin, in particular,
    is a dominant player in the stock market due to its decentralized nature and low transaction fees.
</p>
<p>
    A block is the fundamental unit of information in a blockchain, which contains digital data or information. These
    blocks are secured and connected using cryptography, ensuring data confidentiality and security. These blocks are
    arranged in a chain-like structure, thus forming a distributed public database.
</p>
<h2>Digital information contained on each block consists of three parts.</h2>
<p>
    The first is information about the transaction such as its date, time, and dollar amount.
</p>
<p>
    The second is more specific information related to the participants in the transaction, which is recorded
    anonymously using digital signatures.
</p>
<p>
    The third part is a cryptographic hash function (CHF) that distinguishes the current block from the previous one by
    creating a unique code that is separate from the codes of other blocks.
</p>
<p>
    Each block in a Bitcoin blockchain can store around 1 MB of data, which means that it can hold information about
    thousands of transactions. In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, the transaction must occur and then
    be verified by thousands of computers distributed across the network.
</p>
<p>
    The transaction data is then recorded in a block along with the information from the previous two steps, and a hash
    is created as the final step. The distinction between one block and another is crucial, as it enables the blockchain
    to distinguish between two transactions that are similar but not identical.
</p>
<p>
    Every member of the blockchain network has a copy of the ledger, which is why it is called a distributed ledger.
    Additionally, blockchain networks offer smart contract (chain node) services to applications. Smart contracts create
    blockchain transactions, which are distributed to peer nodes on the network and recorded.
</p>
<h2>Blockchain Developers</h2>
<p>
    Blockchain developers are individuals who are responsible for developing blockchains. There are two types of
    blockchain developers, blockchain software developers, and blockchain developers.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Blockchain Software Developers</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Blockchain software developers create blockchain applications, also known as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank"
        title="Read more about dApps">decentralized applications</a> or dApps. They perform tasks similar to those of
    traditional software developers but with the added responsibility of developing smart contracts using tools such as
    Truffle and Solidity. They may also use languages such as React Native or Java that are commonly used in web and
    mobile app development.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Core Blockchain Developers</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Core blockchain developers are responsible for designing the <a
        href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-structure/"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank"
        title="More details about Blockchain Structure">blockchain architecture</a>. This involves making high-level
    decisions about the design of the blockchain and the consensus protocol, as well as implementing security protocols.
</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Using Blockchain?</h2>
<p>
    Blockchain is known for its high level of security, as the data contained within a block is immutable and can only
    be altered by modifying subsequent blocks. This requires a consensus among the majority of the network, making any
    malicious activity immediately detectable.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, blockchain is highly cost-effective, as there are no transaction fees associated with it, making it a
    great option for businesses looking to save money on financial operations.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, blockchain is an affordable way to establish trust between parties, especially for businesses that need to
    transact with unfamiliar clients. It is not limited to financial transactions but can also be applied to other areas
    such as copyright protection, digital voting, reward programs, medical archiving, and more.
</p>
<h2>Advantages of Using Blockchain</h2>
<p>
    Blockchain technology has several advantages that make it attractive for various use cases beyond just
    cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Some of the key advantages of using blockchain include:
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Decentralization:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries or third parties, as transactions are recorded and verified by a
    network of participants. This not only reduces costs but also enhances transparency and accountability.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>2. Immutability:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Once data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This makes the data tamper-proof and adds an
    extra layer of security.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>3. Security:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Blockchain uses cryptography to encrypt data, making it extremely secure. Transactions can only be added to the
    blockchain after being verified and validated by a consensus of network participants.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>4. Transparency:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Blockchain is a distributed ledger, which means that everyone in the network has access to the same information.
    This enhances transparency and trust among participants.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>5. Efficiency:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Blockchain transactions are fast and efficient, as they don't require intermediaries or lengthy manual processes.
    This can lead to significant cost savings & increased productivity.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, the decentralized and secure nature of blockchain technology makes it useful for a wide range of
    applications, from financial transactions to supply chain management to digital voting and more.
