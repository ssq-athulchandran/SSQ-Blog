<p>
    Agile testing is important in order to ensure that software meets the needs of the customer. Customers are closely
    involved in agile teams so that feedback can be obtained at every stage of the process. This ensures that the
    software is constantly improving. Defects can also be found early in the development process by using agile testing.
</p>
<h2>Agile Software Testing</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://sanesquare.com/services/quality-assurance-and-testing.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">Agile Testing</a> is a type of
    software testing that tests software applications according to the principles of agile software development.
</p>
<p>
    All members of the project team, as well as subject matter experts and testers, participate in agile testing. Agile
    testing is done in every development phase, not in a separate phase i.e. Requirements, design, coding, and test case
    generation. Agile testing happens concurrently throughout the development lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    Agile testers participate in the entire development lifecycle along with members of the development team, testers
    help build software with better design and code enablement as per customer requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Agile testing teams work as one team with one goal: achieving quality. Agile testing has short time windows called
    iterations or loops. This method is also known as delivery-oriented approach because it can better predict viable
    products in less time.
</p>

<h3>Principles of Agile Testing:</h3>
<h4>
    <strong>1. Constant Response</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Agile test implementations provide answers or feedback on an ongoing basis. Therefore, our products can meet your
    business needs.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Less Documentation</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Agile test execution requires less documentation, as Agile teams or all test engineers use reusable specifications
    or checklists. And the team emphasizes testing, not secondary information.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Continuous Testing</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Agile Test Engineers run tests endlessly as this is the only technique to ensure that the product is constantly
    improving.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>4. Customer Satisfaction</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Customer satisfaction is critical in the execution of any project, as the customer is in contact with the product
    throughout the development process. Customers can easily change and update their requirements as the development
    phase progresses. You can also modify your tests according to your updated requirements.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>5. Easy and Clean Code</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    When bugs or bugs encountered by agile or test teams are fixed in similar iterations, resulting in simpler, cleaner
    code.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>6. Involvement of the Entire Team</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    As you know, the test team is the only team responsible for the testing process in the software development
    lifecycle. Agile testing, on the other hand, allows business analysts (BAs) and developers to test applications or
    software as well.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>7. Quick Response</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Every iteration of agile testing involves the business team. Therefore, you can continuously receive feedback and
    help reduce the feedback response time to your development work.
</p>

<h3>Agile Testing Methodologies:</h3>
<p>
    Testing practices are clearly defined for each project, Agile or not, to deliver a quality product. Traditional
    testing principles are often used in agile testing. One of these is early testing, which focuses on:
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Create test cases to express the behavior of your system.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Early error detection, detection and elimination.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        Ensure that the right kind of testing is run at the right time and as part of the right level of testing.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>
    <strong>1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://sanesquare.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-tdd-and-bdd"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">Test-Driven Development (TDD)</a> is
    based on coding guided by tests.The test-driven development method begins with the test itself. As the name
    suggests, TDD changes as the development cycle repeats.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>2. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test-driven_development"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Acceptance Test Driven Development
        (ATDD)</a> is based on communication between customers, developers and testers and is driven by predefined
    acceptance criteria and acceptance test cases.
</p>

<h4>
    <strong>3. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    In <a href="https://sanesquare.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-tdd-and-bdd"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_blank">Behavior Driven Development
        (BDD)</a>, testing is based on the expected behavior of the software being developed.
</p>

<h2>Agile Testing Life Cycle</h2>
<p>
    The Agile Testing Lifecycle is the technique Agile groups use to plan, execute, and track their testing activities.
    The Agile Testing life cycle consists of her four main phases:
</p>
<ol class="ssq-blog-ol">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Planning:</strong>
        The team decides which features are testable and which tests are necessary.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Execution:</strong>
        The team executes the tests.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Tracking:</strong>
        The team tracks the results of the tests and defect reports.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        <strong>Closure:</strong>
        The team reviews the test results and closes out any remaining defects.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Advantages of Agile Testing</h2>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        Agile testing gives a way to get regular feedback and reviews directly from the end-user, which helps us enhance
        the software product's quality and attribute.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        Implementing agile testing saves a lot of time and money and makes cost estimates more transparent.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">Daily meetings allow us to better identify problems.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        Agile testing reduces documentation. Or you could say less documentation is needed to do agile testing.
    </li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 5px !important;">
        The main benefits of implementing agile software testing are fewer errors and increased software productivity.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">
    <strong>The Importance of Agile Software Testing in the Development Process</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application performs its
    intended functions. Benefits of testing include avoiding bugs, reducing development costs, and improving
    performance.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of the traditional waterfall model of a linear approach, Agile testing methods shorten processes, increase
    flexibility, and focus on iteration to build better products. For Agile methodologies, customer feedback is very
    important and helps us make decisions for improvement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        “Agile methodology for project management has many advantages. Agile methodologies help teams manage their work
        more efficiently and do their work more effectively while delivering the highest quality product within budget.”
    </strong>
