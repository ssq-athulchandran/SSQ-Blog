    IT staff augmentation is a process of hiring skilled IT professionals on a contract basis to fulfill temporary or
    long-term IT project needs. It provides companies with the flexibility to scale their IT workforce according to
    their business requirements. In this way, companies can access a larger pool of talent without incurring the costs
    of hiring and maintaining a full-time staff.

<h2>What is Staff Augmentation?</h2>
<p>
    Staff augmentation is a process of hiring specialized professionals temporarily to supplement a company's existing
    workforce. In this model, businesses contract with external agencies or service providers to bring in skilled
    talent, usually for a specific project or duration. Staff augmentation allows businesses to access specialized
    skills without committing to long-term employment or incurring the costs of hiring and training new employees. This
    model is particularly popular in the IT industry, where businesses often require specific technical skills for a
    limited time or project. IT staff augmentation services provide several advantages to businesses looking to grow.
