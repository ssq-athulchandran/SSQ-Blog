    Many front-end apps, particularly those used for enterprise development, are heavily form-driven. Many of these
    applications are really just large forms that span several tabs and dialogue boxes and include complex business
    logic for validation. Here we discuss what are the practical difference between reactive forms & template driven
    forms.

<h2>Ng Model Two Way Binding in Template Driven Form</h2>

<p>
    The simplest way to create a form in
    <a href="https://sanesquare.com/services/hire-angular-developers-staff-augmentation.html"
        target="_blank">Angular</a> is through a
    template-driven approach. In order to construct and manage
    the underlying form object, it makes use of Angular's two-way data-binding directive (ngModel).
</p> <br />
<p>
    Using two-way binding, it is feasible to display a data property and update it in response to user input. The
    two-way binding enables data interaction between components of your app in both directions. You will be able to
    listen to events and update data between parent and child components at the same time. Two-way data binding is
    nothing more than the application of both property binding and event binding. A route from a component to a view is
    through property binding. One route from the view to the component is through the event binding. Both can be
    combined to create a two-way binding.
</p>

<h2>Reactive Form</h2>
<p>
    On the surface, a reactive form resembles a template-driven form quite a bit. Reactive forms are built using
    "ReactiveFormsModule" while template-driven forms use the <em>"FormsModule"</em> Reactive forms are primarily
    synchronous,
    whereas template-driven forms are asynchronous in nature. The domain model is used to bind FormControl objects to
    form control elements provided by Angular ngModel. The
    <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel" target="_blank">ngModel</a> directive can be used to
    link an HTML
    control to an
    application (such as an input, select, or textarea).
</p><br />
<p>
    Forms typically contain several related controls. There are two methods for combining various related controls into
    a single input form using reactive forms. They are form group and form array. Every form in Angular Reactive Forms
    has a form model that is defined programmatically using either the <em>FormControl</em> and <em>FormGroup</em> APIs
    or the shorter
    <em>FormBuilder</em> API.
</p><br />
<p>
    The group name directive on the <em>
        < div>
    </em> allows us to access nested form controls like <em>fromControlName="street"</em> that are children of that
    element
    directlyinstead of writing <em>"street.address"</em> when the address sub-form is implemented inline.
</p><br />
<p>
    Form Group describes a form having a certain number of controls that you can control collectively. The basics of
    form groups are covered in this section. To develop more complicated forms, form groups can also be nested and a
    Form array defines a dynamic form that allows for run-time addition and removal of controls. Form arrays can also be
    nested to produce more complicated shapes. See Creating dynamic forms for additional information on this choice.

<h2>Reactive Forms Validation</h2>
<p>
    Form validation is a crucial step that adds a security layer to prevent unauthorized individuals from abusing web
    forms. Checking that the data is in the correct format before sending it to the server is crucial. This Angular
    forms validation example demonstrates how to correctly validate a form and secure your Angular Application. Reactive
    forms provide a model-driven method of handling form inputs with often changing values.

    Reactive forms and template-driven forms are the two most existing features of form methods in angular. Reactive
    forms are easier to interact with and also easy for error handling. It helps the developers to build pretty good
    forms. Now you Can Implement As Many Ractive & Template driven forms In Your Project As Possible.
