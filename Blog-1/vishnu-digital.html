<p>
    The Indian IT market has been steadily growing since the early 2000s, with many software developers across the
    country finding opportunities to work with global companies and expand their knowledge of new technologies every
    day. However, hiring Indian software developers for IT outsourcing hasn't always been easy-especially because the
    majority of their salaries tend to be lower than those in other parts of the world. But if you consider how
    cost-effective India can be when it comes to employee leasing, you might change your mind about working with local
    software developers altogether..

<h2>Great Pay and Benefits</h2>
<p>
    Hiring <a href="https://sanesquare.com/services/web-design-and-development.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">software developers</a>
    is a great way to improve your bottom line. A good strategy would be to hire an in-house
    developer who will have direct contact with stakeholders, while also hiring out other tasks, like graphic design and
    marketing to external contractors or a third-party firm. A cost-effective way of doing this is by hiring cheap IT
    resources from India.
</p>
<p>
    The cost of living in India is very cheap as compared to other developed nations, which means that you get higher
    quality for less money. Additionally, there are lots of talented but unemployed engineers who are looking for jobs
    and would jump at the chance of getting a big contract from abroad if you ask them nicely and pay them well.
</p>

<h2>A Talented Workforce</h2>
<p>
    India is a country with a large and skilled workforce. By taking advantage of this cheap IT resource, your company
    can save money in the long-run while maintaining high levels of quality. Furthermore, they have a broad range of
    skills that your company may require in one person. For example, if you're looking for someone to do
    <a href="https://sanesquare.com/services/digital-marketing-services.html"
        style="color: rgb(9, 55, 203); font-size: unset !important;" target="_self">Social Media Marketing</a>
    as well as SEO, then India will have the perfect candidate that meets your criteria. Furthermore, India
    offers both entry-level and top-level developers which makes them an even more attractive cheap IT resource because
    they can be deployed anywhere on the project team. It's also worth noting that India has a large number of women in
    STEM fields which is great for companies who want diversity on their teams.
</p>

<h2>Highest Number of Engineer Graduates</h2>
<p>
    India is the world's second-largest producer of engineers, There are more than 240 engineering colleges in India,
    producing 40,000 graduates per year and more than 100,000 qualified teachers. Given these figures, it is not
    surprising that India has emerged as one of the most cost-effective countries for employee leasing. That's why
    international companies hire Indian employees to take on outsourced jobs.
</p>

<ul class="ssq-blog-ul">
    <li>
        The technical level of an average Indian developer is quite high. For example, they may know how to code in many
        programming languages like Java, C#, PHP or Python, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        It won't be wrong to say that India leads the way when it comes to outsourcing due to its cheap labor rate. The
        fact remains that Indians work hard but command lower wages which makes them perfect candidates for outsourcing
        projects where budgets are tight and there is no room for wastage or overspending on salaries.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Indian Leaders in Tech Around the World</h2>
<p>
    At the most recent count, 60 of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are Indian. That's more than any other country on
    the list. The reason is that, from an economic standpoint, India is considered to be the top country for employee
    leasing. That's why international companies hire Indian employees. In addition to this, there are already more than
    400 companies in India that provide services like testing and software development.
