<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
<p>
    Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions between two parties in a secure and
    transparent manner. The data stored in the blockchain cannot be altered or deleted, making it a tamper-proof system.
    Each block in the chain contains a unique code, and all the blocks are connected to form a chain. Blockchain
    technology eliminates the need for intermediaries, which reduces costs and increases efficiency.

<h2>Why Blockchain Application in Education?</h2>
<p>
    The education industry faces numerous challenges, such as lack of transparency, inefficient record-keeping, and the
    high cost of administrative tasks. Blockchain technology can address these issues by providing a secure and
    transparent system for storing and sharing academic records. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that the
    academic records are not tampered with, and the decentralized nature of the system eliminates the need for
    intermediaries.
