    The process of tracking goods throughout the supply chain—from purchase to production to final sale—is referred to
    as an <a href="https://sanesquare.com/services/erp-and-crm.html"

        title="Bets ERP and CRM Development Company">inventory management system</a>. It is also called as an inventory
    system. It manages how your business approaches inventory management. Every business has its own way of managing
    inventory depending on the type and size of the business.
</p>
<h2>Importance of Inventory Management System</h2>
<p>
    A system to precisely track and control stock is necessary for any business that handles it. You will be having
    absolutely no idea of the inventory levels without an inventory tracking system, and you'll quickly run into
    situations where your business has too much or too little inventory. Inventory systems let you know how many parts
    or ingredients are required to make or put together your finished product.
</p>
<p>
    Without this information, you can either have too much inventory, or you can have too little inventory and not be
    able to meet customer demand.
</p>
<p>
    There are numerous types of systems that can be adopted, from simple approaches to comprehensive solutions.
</p>
<h2>Types of Inventory Systems</h2>
<p>
    There are two main methods companies use to manage their inventory: <a

        title="Read more about Perpetual Inventory">Perpetual system</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Periodic Inventory System: Periodic inventory is a type of inventory management that depends only on the number of
    items in stock. Businesses that use a periodic system regularly count their stock on a regular basis, say every
    three to six months, to ensure that stock levels are consistent with sales figures.
</p>
<p>
    Perpetual Inventory System: Perpetual Inventory is a system that tracks inventory as goods are received, produced,
    sold, or returned to stores. With less reliance on stock taking for accuracy, perpetual inventory systems typically
    provide the most recent inventory figures.

<h2>Types of Perpetual Inventory Management System</h2>
<h4>
    <strong>Managing Inventory Using Spreadsheets</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    It is a great way to manage your inventory at a basic level using excel. However, it has some disadvantages also.
    When using spreadsheets, human errors can quickly escalate into costly issues.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Additionally, flexibility and accuracy can frequently be scarce.</strong>
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul" style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>
        <strong>Merit:</strong> Spreadsheets are cheap, genuinely simple to setup, and turn out great for organizations
        with basic requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Demerit:</strong> Your inventory management system also suffers damage if the spreadsheet fails.
        Additionally, your business will quickly become cumbersome as it becomes more complex.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <strong>Basic Inventory Management Software:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Basic inventory management features are included in many cloud-based applications. Although it is not as
    comprehensive as dedicated software, it is for many the natural next step after spreadsheets. However, you might
    discover that you still require spreadsheets to meet your particular needs.
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul" style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>
        <strong>Merit:</strong> The majority of applications are cloud-based, so there is no need to locate and install
        a new solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Demerit:</strong> Usually difficult to match some specific needs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <strong>Enterprise Resource Planning System:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Instead of purchasing multiple cloud components that are interconnected, you purchase a single ERP solution to cover
    all aspects of business planning. Typically, this entails selecting and putting in the "modules" you require,
    including inventory management.
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul" style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>
        <strong>Merit:</strong> A single system that can handle inventory, accounting, supply chain, human resources,
        and more.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Demerit:</strong> Expensive (with ongoing costs for maintenance and upgrades), hard to implement, and
        takes a lot of time and effort to set up; custom software might be better for every job.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <strong>Warehouse Management System:</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    While inventory management systems should not be confused with warehouse management systems, they can be extremely
    useful for inventory control. While many inventory systems may have some functionality to assist with this, it will
    not be as comprehensive as a specialized warehousing tool. Warehouse management is all about giving your warehouse
    team the tools they need to operate as efficiently as possible.
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Dedicated Inventory Management System</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    Software designed specifically for inventory management enables you to track and manage stock. You will be able to
    access your data anywhere, at any time, and sync the software with your other cloud applications if it is
    cloud-based.
</p>
<ul class="ssq-blog-ul" style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>
        <strong>Merit:</strong> An effective solution that is simple to incorporate into other systems. Completely
        adaptable and made just for the specific task.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Demerit:</strong> Needs to be setup right for it to work well.
    </li>
</ul>
